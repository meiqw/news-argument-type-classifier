The year is 1967 and the country is in turmoil over Vietnam and civil rights. While lying on her bed one night and watching TV, she sees a news report about a demonstration. The narrator says something that might apply to today\'s turmoil: "We live in a time of doubt. The institutions we once trusted no longer seem reliable."  &#10;&#10;As 2014 ends, the stock market is at record highs but our traditional institutions and self-confidence are in decline.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;A Pew Research Center study confirms one trend that has been obvious over several years. The "typical" American family is no longer typical. Just 46 percent of American children now live in homes with their married, heterosexual parents. Five percent have no parents at home. They most likely are living with grandparents, says the study.  &#10;&#10;These startling figures about the decline of the American family contrast with the year 1960 when 73 percent of American children lived in traditional families.  &#10;&#10;A major contributor to this trend has been the assault on marriage and other institutions by the Baby Boom generation. It was that generation that promoted cohabitation, no-fault divorce, hatred of the police (they called them "pigs" then, too) and disdain for the military and America, spawned not just by the Vietnam War but a life of relative ease unknown to their parents.  &#10;&#10;The culture bomb dropped by the boomers created fallout still being felt today. The two-plus generations born since the Sixties have been infused with the notion of entitlement, victimhood, envy and greed. Since the elimination of the draft, young people are no longer expected to serve in the military and so most of them pursue whatever goals they wish with no expectation they should give something back to their country. It\'s one possible explanation for why we can no longer seem to win wars.  &#10;&#10;History warns us what happens when empires refuse to teach known values that strengthen societies and help protect them from enemies intent on their destruction.  &#10;&#10;The late British diplomat Sir John Glubb wrote a book called "The Fate of Empires and Search For Survival." Glubb noted the average age of empires since the time of ancient Assyria (859-612 B.C.) is 250 years. Only the Mameluke Empire in Egypt and the Levant (1250-1517) made it as far as 267 years. America is 238 years old and is exhibiting signs of decline.  &#10;&#10;All empires begin, writes Glubb, with the age of pioneers, followed by ages of conquest, commerce, affluence, intellect and decadence. America appears to have reached the age of decadence, which Glubb defines as marked by "defensiveness, pessimism, materialism, frivolity, an influx of foreigners, the welfare state, (and) a weakening of religion."  &#10;&#10;Decadence, he writes, "is due to: Too long a period of wealth and power, selfishness, love of money (and) the loss of a sense of duty."  &#10;&#10;Do these not define America at the end of 2014? Glubb says the 250-year average of empires has not varied in 3,000 years, but we don\'t learn from history because "our studies are brief and prejudiced." He means they are mostly about one\'s own country.  &#10;&#10;It will take more than a new Congress in 2015 and a new president in 2017 to save us from the fate of other empires. It will take a revival of the American spirit, and that can only come through changed attitudes towards our institutions and each other.  	As 2014 ends, the stock market is at record highs but our traditional&#10;institutions and self-confidence are in decline.&#10;&#10;

FILE - In this Dec. 10, 2012 file photo, fog obscures the Capitol dome on Capitol Hill in Washington. ((AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite))  &#10;&#10;A British author, residing in the United States for the past 30 years, created a small firestorm earlier this week with his candid observations that modern- day Americans have been duped by the government into accepting a European- style march toward socialism because we fail to appreciate the rich legacy of personal liberty that is everyone’s birthright and is expressly articulated in the Declaration of Independence and guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.  &#10;&#10;Os Guinness, the author of more than a dozen books defending traditional Judeo-Christian values and Jeffersonian personal liberty, argued that we should embrace individual liberty and personal dignity and reject the “no givens, no rules, no limits” government we now have.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;He went on to opine that the government today is not the constitutionally restrained protector of personal freedoms the Framers left us, but rather has become the wealth-distributing protector of collective interests the Founding Fathers never could have imagined.  &#10;&#10;Yet the problem is a deep one. The Framers believed in the presumption of liberty, which declares that we are free to make personal choices, and the government cannot interfere with our liberties unless we violate the rights of others. Stated differently, the federal government cannot interfere with our personal choices by writing any law it wants; it can only regulate behavior or spend money when the Constitution authorizes it to do so.  &#10;&#10;But for the past 100 years, the federal government has rejected the Madisonian concept that it is limited to the 16 discrete powers the Constitution delegates to it, and has claimed its powers are unlimited, subject only to the express prohibitions in the Constitution. Even those prohibitions can be gotten around since government lawyers have persuaded federal courts to rule that Congress can spend tax dollars or borrowed money on any projects it wishes, whether authorized by the Constitution or not. The courts even have authorized Congress to use federal tax dollars to bribe the states into enacting laws that Congress is powerless to enact, and Congress has done so.  &#10;&#10;The Declaration of Independence defines our personal liberties as inalienable aspects of our humanity, and the Constitution prohibits the government from interfering with those liberties -- like thought, speech, press, association, worship, self-defense, travel, privacy, due process, use of money and private property, to name a few.  &#10;&#10;The teaching of these founding documents is that our liberties are natural -- their source is not the government -- and they are personal, not collective. We don’t need a government permission slip to exercise them; we don’t need to belong to a group to enjoy them; they cannot be taken away by a congressional vote or a presidential signature.  &#10;&#10;Even though everyone who works for the government takes an oath to uphold the Declaration and the Constitution, very few are consistent with what they have sworn to do. We know that because on the transcendental issues of our day -- life, liberty, war and debt -- the leadership of both political parties and the behavior of all modern presidents have revealed a steadfast willingness to write any law and regulate any behavior or permit any evil, whether authorized by the Constitution or not.  &#10;&#10;Take life. Abortion is the most deadly force in America today. Abortions lawfully kill a baby a minute -- that’s 1.1 million babies a year and 45,000,000 killed since the Supreme Court issued its Roe v. Wade decision in 1973. A simple one-line statute -- “The fetus in the womb is a legal person” -- could have been enacted by a simple majority vote in Congress and signed into law by any of our so-called pro-life presidents, thus stopping the slaughter. It never happened.  &#10;&#10;Take liberty. Both parties support the Patriot Act and the secret FISA apparatus, which together invade privacy, infringe upon free speech, permit federal agents to write their own search warrants and allow domestic spying on all of us all the time. This demonstrates that our political leaders do not believe that our rights are inalienable, but can be interfered with and regulated by them. They have written laws that literally permit federal agents to do the very acts the Constitution was written to prohibit.  &#10;&#10;Take the lethal combination of war and debt. Both parties support perpetual war and perpetual debt. The leadership of both parties has permitted every modern president to kill whomever he pleases in foreign countries without lawful declarations of war and to do so by going into a $17 trillion hole of debt, with no end in sight. Today, 20 cents of every tax dollar collected goes to interest on pre-existing government debt. Today’s taxpayers are still paying interest on the $30 billion Woodrow Wilson borrowed to finance World War I in 1917.  &#10;&#10;The British author is correct. Unless we have a radical change in the direction of government -- its size, cost, focus, intrusiveness and rejection of first principles -- and unless we elect people to the government who truly believe the Declaration and the Constitution mean what they say, we will continue our march toward the federal destruction of the presumption of liberty. It is a slow march, but a steady one.  	Unless we have a radical change in the direction of government -- its size,&#10;cost, focus, intrusiveness and rejection of first principles -- and unless we&#10;elect people to the government who truly believe the Declaration and the&#10;Constitution mean what they say, we will continue our march toward the federal&#10;destruction of the presumption of liberty.&#10;&#10;

Russian President Vladimir Putin smiles during a live video link with members of Russian Geographical Society expedition to the Southern Pole in Moscow\'s Kremlin, Russia on Friday, Dec. 26, 2014. (AP Photo/RIA Novosti, Alexei Druzhinin, Presidential Press Service)  &#10;&#10;“The bear never asks permission,” remarked Vladmir Putin on a TV promo for his annual news conference.Yes, we know.  &#10;&#10;The Russians haven’t stopped their aggressive posturing after annexing Crimea—not by a long-shot. In early December there was another near miss between a Russian military jet with its transponders turned off and a commercial airliner just south of Sweden.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;This adds to the list of over 40 serious incidents involving Russia and NATO countries in the last 8 months, as detailed in a report by a British think tank called the European Leadership Network.  &#10;&#10;President Obama has so far remained unwilling to do little more than levy pin- prick sanctions against specific Russian individuals, but that doesn’t mean Congress is sitting still.  &#10;&#10;Republicans have continued to show a willingness to get tough with Russia to actually deter it. And now the New Year ushers in a Republican majority in the Senate, and a freshly motivated Republican House.  &#10;&#10;Several Senators have argued the U.S. should impose much tougher sanctions on whole sectors of the Russian economy, provide significant arms to Ukraine and NATO allies in the region, and should go back to an emphasis on building out missile defense in Europe.  &#10;&#10;Moscow has long opposed U.S. missile defense in countries that were once forcibly a part of the Soviet Union. Recall the now infamous abandonment by President Obama of the Bush plan to deploy 10 large interceptors in Poland in an effort to appease Russia. Those same interceptors might not be deployed, but the current and more modest plans to build up defenses, could be adapted. Congressman Mike Tuner, R-Ohio, said in a statement released on December 18, "Given Russia\'s increased aggression toward the West and Iran\'s stubbornness toward its nuclear program, we must ensure a robust BMD capability in Europe. Russia is clearly now a threat to the West."  &#10;&#10;For years the U.S. has insisted that homeland missile defense systems will not be targeted at Russian assets in order to maintain a "strategic balance" between the former Cold War foes. This remains the position of the U.S. as laid out in a 2010 policy document called the Ballistic Missile Defense Review (BMDR). It is not, however, codified in law.  &#10;&#10;And since the U.S. began deploying more missile defense systems abroad to protect allies and U.S. troops from Iranian missiles, officials have made the case that they were not defending against the shorter range Russian systems. But this may change; and if it does, it will be the fault of the Russian government, and to the credit of American officials who are paying close attention.  &#10;&#10;Unconvinced that the U.S. is not threatening its military, Russia has moved forward with an aggressive plan to improve in quality and quantity its offensive missile forces and continues to threaten its neighbors (U.S. allies) with them, even threatening to use—preemptively—nuclear weapons. The revelations that Russia has been in violation of the INF Treaty has also ushered in some bipartisan agreement that perhaps the U.S. should rethink its position regarding missile defense and Russia.  &#10;&#10;Democratic Senator Joe Donnelly, R-Ind., raised the issue of speeding up and strengthening U.S. missile defense in Europe in the context of Russian aggression during an April 2, 2014 Senate hearing.  &#10;&#10;In the recent omnibus bill Congress approved $20 million to do just that -- speed up the deployment of the European Phased Adaptive Approach -- a missile defense plan to deploy missile defense assets in Europe to protect against the regional Iranian threats.  &#10;&#10;Between the failure of the infamous “Iran deal” to curb Iranian missile development and Russia’s continued aggression in the region, this makes perfect sense and is good policy.  &#10;&#10;In a recent trip to Eastern Europe, the Chairman of the House Strategic Forces Subcommittee, Congressman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., stated that the interceptors in Europe could be made to defend against some Russian threats.  &#10;&#10;As one can imagine, this didn’t thrill the Russians—but short of American decline, what does?  &#10;&#10;Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said in a statement, "Hence, the U.S. lawmaker confirmed the justifiability of concerns having been aired by Moscow for a long time that the missile shield being developed by the U.S. is intended solely for the purposes officially declared by Washington.”  &#10;&#10;If the U.S. does configure systems to protect its allies against Russian missiles, it is because it will be because Uncle Sam finally stopped “asking permission” and decided to get serious about deterring “the bear.”  	The Russians haven’t stopped their aggressive posturing after annexing&#10;Crimea—not by a long-shot. Earlier this month there was another near miss&#10;between a Russian military jet with its transponders turned off and a&#10;commercial airliner just south of Sweden.&#10;&#10;
004-300poundsjobreferenceexploitat	guardian	2015-01-12T13:33:05Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/12/300-pounds-job-reference-exploitation-interns	Erica Buist	£300 for a job reference is the latest outrage in the exploitation of interns	If there were an award for scummiest business practice, refusing to pay interns would get many a vote. But Jan Mortier, who until a year ago ran a “junior associates” programme through his thinktank Civitatis International, has upped the stakes by charging former interns (or trainees, as he prefers to think of them) a £300 fee for an employment reference.  &#10;&#10;Is charging someone for a reference after refusing to pay them as scummy as it gets? Sadly not. Young people are lucky if unpaid work is the worst deal they are offered: although the “junior associates” programme was advertised on Internwise, the three-month programme cost more than £1,600. (Mortier insists it was a training course, not an internship.) And the winner is …  &#10;&#10;But how on Earth did Mortier think he could get away with charging for references, never mind the extortionate fee of £300? His market is ambitious but terrified young people who are overqualified and unemployed – and there is easy money to be made from them, for three reasons.  &#10;&#10;First, they’ve been sent the message that they’re of little value to the economy. Government and businesses have spent the entire economic crisis suggesting that young people lack employable skills. Repeated references to these elusive skills rarely lead to any kind of specific mention of what they are – or an investigation into why schools and universities stopped teaching them just as the economy collapsed. If you’ve spent your life in education only to be called unemployable, the idea that you’d have to pay someone to say nice things about you doesn’t seem so far-fetched.  &#10;&#10;Second, while young people as a group tend not to have much money sloshing around, their parents and grandparents are supposedly doing OK. People wanting what’s best for their kids leads easily to the coughing-up of cash.  &#10;&#10;Third, when it comes to looking for a job, young people are so used to mounting hindrances that you can stick on another like an extra bottle on a drunk’s bar tab. Legend has it that people used to get a job by seeing one they wanted, and applying; then came the time when they needed qualifications to get the same job; then they needed better qualifications; then they would have to do an unpaid internship; then to prove it wasn’t all a fluke they’d have to get qualifications and do an internship.  &#10;&#10;Now, Civitatis would have you believe that if you attend its summer school you “will gain the advantage over others for internship (sic)”. So, £300 for a reference? Stick it on the bill.  &#10;&#10;But the damage caused by charging for references isn’t limited to the spineless gouging of money from naive young people trying to get their first job. A reference is immediately invalid once money changes hands. The value of a reference lies in the assumption that it’s an honest comment on a person’s job performance or character. The price tag Mortier has attached isn’t, as he claims, a “fair administrative fee”. It’s enough to make a pocket bulge, and certainly enough to be considered a bribe: no one pays £300 to be damned with faint praise. Anyone reading a reference signed by Mortier knows he’s been paid hundreds for whatever he’s written, so it will ring hollow.  &#10;&#10;Getting a job with worthless education and months-long application processes is already hard enough. If this idea catches on, references as a measure of a potential candidate will be as devalued as our degrees.  	Erica Buist: The damage isn’t limited to the gouging of money from young people – a reference is invalid if money has changed hands

As my home fills with the joy and laughter of my six children and four grandchildren, I’m reminded of how lucky I am to have the most wonderful job in the world – being a mother and grandmother. It’s the single most important thing I’ve done with my life, and I know just how important the job is because I am constantly reminded of what an influence my own mother was in my life. My mother Mieke survived three and a half horrific years in a Japanese concentration camp during World War II. During that time, she focused all of her energy on caring for fellow prisoners who were far worse off than she was.  &#10;&#10;When I think of my mother, I think of the selfless love she had not only for my family, but for complete strangers as well. She’s with me every day as I challenge myself to live my life in the same way. I am so blessed to have a wonderful family and career that I love, and I see my mother in all of those things. I see her every day in the faces of my children and grandchildren. I am reminded of her each time a single white feather floats through the air – whether on good days or bad days – and I have to smile knowing that she is always with me. Her love is reflected in my work as an actor, artist and philanthropist. Without her example, I wouldn’t be who I am today and while I miss her endlessly during the holidays, I know that if I live my life the way she did, I will make the same impact on my family and that is truly a gift.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  	The holidays are my favorite time of year.

006-afghanistanatcrucialjuncture	aljazeera	Wed, 03 Dec 2014 08:32:50 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/afghanistan-at-crucial-juncture-201412212738592754.html	Shashank Joshi	Afghanistan at crucial juncture	On Thursday, the so-called London Conference on Afghanistan will convene. Of all the high-profile international conferences that have been held on Afghanistan over the years - in Bonn, Tokyo, and Istanbul - this comes at a crucial juncture.  &#10;&#10;At the end of October, British forces lowered the flag at Camp Bastion - from where they had engaged in the most intense fighting the British army had seen since the Falklands War - and handed over the base to Afghan forces. Just over a month later, the Taliban mounted a 14-hour attack on the very same site, killing six Afghan soldiers. To the north, in the capital Kabul, insurgents have pulled off a dozen attacks in the space of the last few weeks, striking at diplomats, NGOs, and US contractors. What explains this spate of violence, and is it a portent for the future of Afghanistan?  &#10;&#10;The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), a US-led group that includes NATO members and others, winds up its mission on New Year's Eve. A slimmed-down force of 12,000 foreign troops - mostly American - will stay behind, and US President Barack Obama has authorised the US contingent to continue supporting Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) throughout 2015, with all of these forces scheduled to leave by the end of 2016. The US is not, therefore, leaving Afghanistan in the abrupt manner than it left Iraq in 2011. But this is a time of dramatic change.  &#10;&#10;Drastic effects on casualties  &#10;&#10;For one thing, the ANSF are doing much of the fighting themselves, with drastic effects on casualties: over 9,000 Afghan troops have died since 2013, four times greater than the entire American death toll since 2001. Afghan police officers are suffering especially badly, with thousands being killed every month.  &#10;&#10;At the political level, a new government of national unity, led by President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, has taken charge after Hamid Karzai's departure.  &#10;&#10;Ghani is already reported to have opened backchannel talks with the Taliban, visiting both Pakistan and Beijing to seek their help in this effort, cancelling an earlier arms request from India, and even making a highly unorthodox visit to Pakistan's army headquarters, in recognition of Pakistan's long-standing support for the insurgents.  &#10;&#10;On the ground, the overall picture is mixed. This year, Taliban-initiated attacks are reported to have fallen by 25 percent, and ANSF mounted offensives four to five times more frequently than last year. At the same time, as political scientist Jason Lyall observed, the recently-concluded fighting season - from April to October - "witnessed the appearance of large Taliban units on the battlefield" for the first time, with a tenth of all Afghan districts seeing "at least one major Taliban offensive".  &#10;&#10;Lyall also notes reports of over 1,000 insurgents on the battlefield, "numbers not seen since the Taliban's original push to capture Kabul during the 1992-96 civil war". While we should take these reports with a pinch of salt - NATO commanders accuse their Afghan counterparts of exaggerating - they do point to a simple, stark fact: The insurgency is far from broken, and it will be able to pressure the Afghan state for years to come.  &#10;&#10;In this context, the wave of insurgent attacks might be explained in several ways.  &#10;&#10;First, these attacks might be intended to drive a wedge between the Afghan government and its foreign patrons, encouraging the latter to abandon their allies more quickly. As a Taliban spokesman put it bluntly: "Our objective is to force the foreigners to flee Kabul. Before, the foreigners were visible in the provinces. Now that they have limited more of their activities to Kabul, we have also gone to Kabul to target them there." To some extent, this has worked. Many aid agencies have pulled out their staff, and restricted their movements.  &#10;&#10;Tarnished credibility  &#10;&#10;Second, the insurgents failed to seriously disrupt either round of this year's Afghan elections, as they had vowed to do, leaving their credibility somewhat tarnished. Prominent attacks - publicised with videos - redress this issue, and project strength at the end of a fighting season. They might also be ways of strengthening the insurgency's bargaining position in advance of any peace talks that gain momentum over the next year.  &#10;&#10;Third, the insurgency is not a monolith, and different parts of the Taliban might be responsible for different attacks. The Haqqani Network, a semi- autonomous group with close ties to Pakistani intelligence, has proven most effective at projecting suicide bombings into Kabul. The Haqqanis were blamed for the most deadly atrocity of the past month, the bombing of a volleyball game in which over 50 Afghans were killed. In the past, moves towards dialogue between the Afghan government and the Taliban have been met with carefully targeted attacks intended less to strengthen bargaining positions than to disrupt such talks altogether.  &#10;&#10;Whatever the explanation, Afghanistan faces an extremely test period. Although the presence of US forces provides a safety net throughout next year, things look more precarious after that. International funding commitments for Afghanistan currently run to 2017, but that timeline had assumed the insurgency would lose steam by then, allowing ANSF to slim down. If that isn't possible, the annual $4-6bn bill for the security forces is simply unsustainable.  &#10;&#10;This week's London Conference is an opportunity to secure much greater contributions from regional powers, who have the most at stake if Afghanistan does fall apart once more. China is, for instance, one of the world's largest economies, a direct neighbour of Afghanistan, and a significant investor there. But if Beijing is unwilling to offer more than a meagre $327m - nearly half the amount Iran pledged in 2012, and far less than Japan or the EU - then how are western governments, with their attention directed to threats from Russia and ISIL, supposed to persuade their own public that, after a decade of war, Afghanistan must stay on financial life-support?  	Can western governments persuade their people that after years of war,&#10;Afghanistan must stay on financial life-support?&#10;&#10;
007-afghanistanconferencewonrock	aljazeera	Wed, 03 Dec 2014 12:39:38 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/afghanistan-conference-won-rock--20141235275853458.html	Helena Malikyar	Afghanistan conference won't rock the boat	"The London Conference on Afghanistan will provide an opportunity for the government of Afghanistan to set out its commitment to reform," states the UK government's official webpage of the upcoming meeting between the new Afghan government and its international donors. The conference is also an opportunity for the international community "to reaffirm its long-term commitment to supporting Afghanistan's peaceful development".  &#10;&#10;Despite the media hype, the London Conference is nothing more than a routine reunion, set by the 2012 Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework (TMAF). As part of the agreement, donors pledged support and the Afghan government promised to implement reforms and curb corruption. The upcoming meeting in the British capital, therefore, is the first in a series of exchanges that will be held every two years, at the ministerial level, between the Afghan and donor governments to assess progress and check TMAF's benchmarks.  &#10;&#10;Still, the December 4 conference has the potential to ease Afghanistan into a stable and increasingly self-sufficient future and render it a reliable global partner for ensuring peace and stability in the region and beyond.  &#10;&#10;To utilise this opportunity as more than a routine progress assessment requires a fundamental shift of attitude on both sides. Lack of concrete success in the military, economic development and governance efforts in post- Taliban Afghanistan needs to be sincerely examined and adjustments need to be made.  &#10;&#10;There is multitude of examples in the international community's flawed, if not disingenuous, aid programmes and their monitoring in Afghanistan. I was hired by a US consultancy firm to map out the field and offer recommendations for the design of a multimillion dollar governance project. My report and recommendations, it turned out, were too radical.  &#10;&#10;"We expected recommendations for cosmetic changes to the ongoing programmes," I was told. "The donor agency does not want to rock the boat."  &#10;&#10;On another occasion, I was interviewed by a European consultant for his assessment of the first phase of a programme that had consistently been showcased as a "success story" by donors and the Afghan government.  &#10;&#10;In his three-day field trip to Kabul, he had held meetings with three embassies, the UN, the Afghan head of the implementing agency and me. Eagerly, I began to point to the flaws of the programme and offered suggestions for improvement. I also offered assistance for site visits.  &#10;&#10;"Don't waste your time and mine," the septuagenarian consultant told me. "The donor agency expects a rosy report highlighting only the positive."  &#10;&#10;He further clarified that the decision to fund the second phase had already been made and it had more to do with international aid politics, than development logic.  &#10;&#10;Numbers provide an easy way to illustrate success, especially when seeking international aid budget approval from legislative bodies. While figures indicating Afghanistan's progress towards development are impressive and could not have been achieved without generous international assistance, they conceal a lack of attention to quality.  &#10;&#10;About 8 million Afghan children - including over 2.5 million girls - are now in school. This is a figure cited regularly as an indication that the programmes are yielding tangible results.  &#10;&#10;The fact that most of them graduate only half-literate is never revealed.  &#10;&#10;Here's another feel-good figure: More than 60 percent of the Afghan population now has access to healthcare facilities. The fact that some of those facilities have only received a checkmark because merely a building was constructed and many are staffed only with a nurse, have no diagnostic technology and have terribly anaemic pharmaceutical offerings is often ignored.  &#10;&#10;Much has been written about the fact that a hefty portion of the aid money goes back to donor countries because of the donors' insistence to award contracts to their own citizens. The contracts move hand to hand and finally local non-governmental agencies are hired to implement projects. At this point, while at best one-quarter of the original funds remains to be spent on the actual project, quality is grossly compromised and monitoring becomes either too complex or irrelevant.  &#10;&#10;The international community has also created an indigenous vehicle for channelling portions of its assistance. Under the guise of "civil society", hundreds of Afghan NGOs have been established since 2002. This artificial civil society’s lifeline is the donor community in Kabul. Projects and funds are handed to them for implementation and as the closing of fiscal year in donor capitals approaches, generosity in disbursing funds, irrespective of the projects' logic, utility and cost increases.  &#10;&#10;Where the funds go  &#10;&#10;Granted that when international aid began to pour in, the Afghan state had very small, if any, capacity to absorb and spend it. However, after 13 years and millions of dollars spent on public sector capacity building, the bulk of the funds continue to be spent directly by donors and only a little over 20 percent is given to the Afghan government.  &#10;&#10;The parallel system and structures offering higher salaries paid in US dollars have lured much of the skilled Afghan human resources. The Afghan administration, thus, has to be grateful to donors for funding training workshops, while in the end, loses its best trained personnel to international organisations, consulting firms and embassies.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;It is often said that rampant Afghan corruption and lack of capacity would result in misuse and waste of donors' funds. A mere review of reports published by the US oversight agency, Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), reveals the depth and extent of waste, fraud and abuse of the direct US aid to Afghanistan just in reconstruction projects. Similar monitoring of most donors' direct aid will, no doubt, highlight comparable corruption and waste.  &#10;&#10;The government of former President Hamid Karzai admittedly failed to launch a genuine fight against corruption. Lack of capacity for a governance vision that would make optimum use of international aid was also a defect of the previous leadership.  &#10;&#10;High-level appointments were based not on competence and commitment of individuals, but rather on political affiliations and compromises on the one hand, and submissiveness of a handful of "yes sir" entities on the other.  &#10;&#10;Thus, both sides - donors and the Afghan government - went on for a decade playing a futile blame game, each accusing the other of corruption and insincerity.  &#10;&#10;Now, on the eve of the London Conference, a new page has turned in Afghanistan's leadership and governance. The level of optimism among ordinary Afghans is only comparable to the euphoria of the first weeks following the fall of the Taliban regime. This renewed domestic hope and confidence in the new leadership must not be let to deflate.  &#10;&#10;Although the new administration has not yet launched its overhauling programme, President Ashraf Ghani's vision and capacity is well known. Donors at the London Conference must seize the chance and afford him confidence. They must also adapt a fundamentally new approach to dispensing their generous assistance to Afghanistan.  &#10;&#10;A significant funnelling of international aid through the Afghan government (with oversight and accountability benchmarks), a shift of emphasis from quantity to quality, with particular focus on raising the quality of education and finally, a sincere commitment from both sides to the establishment of rule of law will ensure the stability and eventual self-reliance of Afghanistan.  	A monitoring of most donors' direct aid to Afghanistan will highlight alarming&#10;corruption and waste.&#10;&#10;

After 13 years of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), the United States and a number of its NATO partners will start the Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan. The number of NATO and US forces is reduced from 140,000 to 13,500 - most of them American - starting January 1.  &#10;&#10;How will the new national unity government in Kabul weather the NATO drawdown, despite a resilient insurgency and intensified fighting?  &#10;&#10;There has been much speculation about the security transition in 2014 in Afghanistan. In 2012, I wrote an Oped for the New York Times, warning that "Kabul risks political meltdown". Many other analysts have also predicted a sombre year, particularly after the refusal of former President Hamid Karzai to sign the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) with the US.  &#10;&#10;However, for the time being, we were all proved wrong as the democratic process that began at the Bonn Conference in 2001, survived, and the country was saved from the brink of a new civil war.  &#10;&#10;Indeed we have achieved important strategic gains in the last few months, starting with the landmark peaceful transfer of political power from one democratically elected leader to another, for the first time in Afghanistan's history. This milestone was made possible by the will of ordinary Afghan people, who twice braved the threat of violence imposed by the Taliban and came out en masse, voting for their candidates of choice.  &#10;&#10;Meanwhile, the Taliban has tried hard to undermine the electoral process. By confronting Afghan security forces in 16 different provinces, they wanted to gain significant territory, thus declaring themselves as an alternative governing force in the country.  &#10;&#10;Nevertheless, the Afghan security forces have been able to hold ground and push back the insurgent offensives in almost all fronts, which has became a source of pride for the Afghan government and people.  &#10;&#10;This proved wrong skeptics who doubted the capacity of the Afghan security forces to defend their country, which has taken responsibility for security in many provinces since the start of the security transition in 2012.  &#10;&#10;Following the inauguration of President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Abdullah Abdullah, the BSA was immediately signed, approved by an overwhelming majority of Afghan Members of Parliament.  &#10;&#10;In addition to the BSA, the signing of the Status of Force Agreement (SOFA) between NATO and the new Afghan government has created a new momentum in the country, while ensuring continued military and financial assistance for the new government. This has inherited an economic crisis, characterised by a fiscal gap resulting from the failures of the previous government.  &#10;&#10;Afghanistan's strategic gains are still contingent upon two important factors. Firstly, there must be continued NATO support for the Afghan security forces. This is done by building the capacity of the forces; providing adequate resources such as fire power and particularly air power; assisting in intelligence gathering; and logistics support.  &#10;&#10;Without the technical and financial support from the US and NATO countries, the Afghan security forces will not be able to sustain a high rate of casualties against the Taliban. For instance in 2014, an additional 5,000 members of the Afghan security forces were killed either in direct fighting against the Taliban or because of terrorist attacks such as suicide and road side bombings.  &#10;&#10;Secondly, the government has the capacity to reform the security intuitions in order to reduce the level of corruption and eliminate political influence exercised by important power brokers. The financing of the Afghan security forces are beyond the Afghan government's resources and is totally dependent on donors' contribution.  &#10;&#10;The government could make significant contributions by reducing costs.  &#10;&#10;This could be done through reducing corruption and improving management. Meanwhile, eliminating political influence in appointments of senior officials and promotion of officers could boost the morale of the security forces and increase their fighting capacity.  &#10;&#10;Alas, despite tremendous strategic gains, the new National Unity Afghan government is struggling with key cabinet appointments, particularly in the security sector, which might have been caused by heavy political influence by power brokers.  &#10;&#10;In fact, failures inherited from the previous government such as bad governance, corruption, nepotism and many other symptoms that have caused a growing popular resentment, remain a serious threat to the national unity government.  &#10;&#10;While people admit that improvements in the security and economic sectors require time, they will not tolerate any failure in fixing a dysfunctional government which has failed to address endemic corruption and a culture of impunity.  &#10;&#10;The inability of the new national unity government to implement a comprehensive reform agenda, could undermine the security transition. It is clear to us in Afghanistan that the donor countries will not tolerate anymore corruption and bad governance, which could weaken their financial commitments pledged during the NATO Summit in Wales.  &#10;&#10;Any reduction in funding for the Afghan government could negatively impact the Afghan security forces, while the Taliban will increase their offensive.  &#10;&#10;The biggest test for the security transition is ahead of us because the insurgents will further intensify their attacks in the beginning of next spring and we might see a Taliban surge next summer.  &#10;&#10;The Afghan government has little time to prepare itself for the upcoming fighting season, which has impacted the US and NATO military missions in Afghanistan since 2001.

009-aftercharliehebdoattackisla	aljazeera	Sun, 11 Jan 2015 10:40:16 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/01/after-charlie-hebdo-attack-isla-201511163959248129.html	Daoud Kuttab	After Charlie Hebdo attack, the real war 	France's Prime Minister Manuel Valls has said that his country is now at war with radical Islam.  &#10;&#10;"It is a war against terrorism, against jihadism, against radical Islam, against everything that is aimed at breaking fraternity, freedom, solidarity," Valls said during a speech on Saturday in Evry, south of Paris.  &#10;&#10;What is "radical Islam"? Is there such a thing? And how does this affect the ongoing US-led war on extremism - the most tangible form being ISIL who have controlled large segments of land and people in northern Iraq and eastern Syria?  &#10;&#10;Very few people know that in Islam there are two kinds of "jihad". The smaller jihad is the more known - namely the one which reflects the military struggle. But the greater jihad, which is less known, is the internal jihad - or struggle.  &#10;&#10;Few people also know that the Arabic word "jihad" is used throughout the Bible as well, although certainly not in the militaristic sense. 2 Timothy 4:7 states: "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith." The verse in Arabic uses the term "jihad" for the word "fight".  &#10;&#10;So whether it is this struggle or the fight for a better world, the militaristic jihad is certainly not a monopoly for Islamists.  &#10;&#10;World leaders have correctly pointed out that the fight against ISIL must be waged both on the military and ideological levels. But we must be careful about the idea of conflating Islam with radicalism. People and ideas might be radical but to target a religion with radicalism adds insult to injury and shifts from the proper focus which is the individually created extremism.  &#10;&#10;We have heard and seen a lot of the former, but very little has been done to tackle the ideologies behind this extreme group.  &#10;&#10;The need to deal with the extreme thoughts connected to this movement was made clear by extremists who carried out the heinous attack against a French satirical newspaper; most likely because of the ideas it has espoused.  &#10;&#10;Whenever violent acts take place, the natural response is to militarily obliterate the group or militia behind it. There might be a good case for a military response but it would be a totally counterproductive effort if it is not accompanied by an equally strong ideological response.  &#10;&#10;It might be possible to kill the holders of some of these ideas but everyone knows that you can't kill ideas by using force. Extremist ideology must be tackled in a number of ways.  &#10;&#10;The most important ideological response to extremism is the need to show that there are better and more effective ways to deal with the various issues that make extremism popular. This includes the need to introduce real political reform in the countries that are of importance to the people that follow these extreme leaders.  &#10;&#10;It applies both to the Arab countries whose autocratic leadership has left a large sector of the public without any say in what happens to them. But it also applies to the need to continue stemming racism and Islamophobia from many of the western countries where some homegrown terrorism seems to be gaining strength.  &#10;&#10;The issue is complicated by murderous acts like those committed in Paris, which tend to increase rather than decrease anti-Islamic sentiments.  &#10;&#10;In addition to political changes that must be introduced, Arab and Muslim intellectuals and leaders must end their self-imposed silence and speak out clearly and unabashedly. There is no reason to keep repeating that these actions are not a reflection of true Islam. What is needed is for writers and thinkers to produce concrete and practical thoughts and ideas that can be applicable to the 21st century.  &#10;&#10;Today's Arab and Muslim youth need to find alternative role models and alternative ideas that they can adopt in this struggle of ideas that extremists are working tirelessly to defend - and to which the other side is only paying lip service.  &#10;&#10;One successful idea called takween (seen on the local Jordanian website, ammannet.net) has seen an increase in audience as reformed independent writers from various backgrounds (culture, media, women's issues and workers rights) are producing daily analysis that is the anti-thesis to ISIL's ideology.  &#10;&#10;The individual efforts by some intellectuals is to be supported but much more is necessary. The anti-extremism military effort can't yield positive results if there isn't a combined change in how ruling governments conduct their affairs (especially on the economic empowerment front), and how to tackle every one of the extremists' thoughts, ideas and practices.  &#10;&#10;The battle will be long and cumbersome but in order to win, all people of good will must work together to produce what is good and uplifting for a better future for all.  	We must be careful about the idea of conflating Islam with radicalism.&#10;&#10;
010-americanevertortureagainlawsci	guardian	2015-01-08T13:31:44Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/08/america-never-torture-again-laws-cia	Katherine Hawkins	If America wants to make sure it never tortures again, it must choose law over secrecy	On Monday afternoon, Senator Dianne Feinstein released a letter to Barack Obama, suggesting a series of reforms “to make sure that the United States never again engages in actions that you have acknowledged were torture”.  &#10;&#10;A month after her office released the landmark (but still heavily redacted) Senate torture report, Feinstein is now calling for legislation to strengthen the prohibition against torture. This is a laudable and necessary step, but torture has been a felony for decades. So have war crimes, lying to Congress and obstruction of justice. The fundamental problem is that the US government has been unable or unwilling to enforce those laws against the CIA. If reform does not confront the reasons for that failure, it may not deter the United States from engaging in torture under a future president.  &#10;&#10;To the extent that federal prosecutors have simply lacked the political will to investigate the CIA, there’s not much Congress can do about it. But legislation could address many of the other factors that allowed the CIA to torture prisoners, destroy evidence and lie to investigators with impunity. There is the CIA’s reliance on secret “torture memos” written by the Office of Legal Counsel – which exploited some weaknesses in the legal definition of torture, but depended far more heavily on absurd legal arguments and false representations of fact by the CIA. There’s the unethical role of CIA doctors and psychologists in monitoring interrogations. And above all, there remains the CIA’s ability to keep all the evidence of its crimes classified.  &#10;&#10;The only explanation the justice department has ever provided for the failure to indict a single CIA officer for torture, war crimes, homicide, destruction of evidence or any of the other crimes the Senate report documents is a bland statement that “the admissible evidence would not be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt”. The justice department refuses to answer questions about the role played by top-secret classification in that decision, or disclose any of the records from the criminal investigations.  &#10;&#10;But we do know that until the Senate report was released, the Obama administration took the position that every detail of an individual detainee’s torture in CIA custody was top secret – including former CIA prisoners’ memories of their own treatment, the locations of black sites and the names of all the witnesses. We know the CIA redacted from the report not only the names but even the pseudonyms of nearly every CIA officer and contractor involved in the program, and every country that hosted a black site. And we know that every last civil suit brought by CIA torture victims has been dismissed on national security grounds. So it’s difficult to imagine how a prosecutor could have made a torture case against the CIA without disclosing this evidence – and even harder to imagine the agency allowing its release.  &#10;&#10;In theory, Obama’s December 2009 executive order on national security classification should prevent the CIA from using secrecy to place itself beyond the rule of law, since the order specifically forbids classifying information to “conceal violations of law”. In practice, though, the prohibition is virtually never enforced. The Obama administration – like the Bush administration before it – takes the position that the CIA’s criminal actions can be legitimately classified if they are “intelligence sources and methods”. And neither Congress, nor the president, nor the courts have imposed any legal limit on what counts as an intelligence source or method. In practice, the phrase has come to mean “anything the intelligence community doesn’t want you to know.” Congress needs to write a legal definition of “intelligence sources and methods” that imposes real limits, and makes clear that it excludes torture and other crimes.  &#10;&#10;Feinstein and her staff deserve tremendous credit for finally breaking through the wall of secrecy that the CIA built around its torture program, in the face of fierce opposition from the agency and the White House. But their investigation did not begin until after the black-site program had already ended, in large part because of leaks to the press. Despite staffers’ scrupulous protection of classified information, the CIA subjected them to unlawful surveillance, tried to have them prosecuted and is still trying to retaliate. Yet the report is still full of unjustified redactions, and the Department of Justice refuses to either reopen its criminal investigations into torture or explain why they were closed in the first place.  &#10;&#10;As it stands right now, torture is a crime – but so is revealing evidence of torture that the CIA wants hidden. And it’s only the second crime that gets you prosecuted. Yes, let’s strengthen the laws against torture. But let’s also weaken the CIA’s power to conceal the evidence.  	Katherine Hawkins: Memos to Obama aren’t enough when neither politicians, nor the president, nor the courts can stand up to the CIA’s wall of secrecy. Let’s tear down that wall
011-amnesiaimmigrationeuropelesson	guardian	2015-01-06T19:15:11Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/06/amnesia-immigration-europe-lesson-grim-history-future-multicultural	Natalie Nougayrède	Amnesia, not immigration, is our problem	It has been a grim start for 2015 as far as European tolerance is concerned. Mosques have been attacked in Sweden. Demonstrations continue in Germany against the “Islamisation of the west”. And antisemitism is on the rise.  &#10;&#10;We knew something nasty had been unleashed when the European elections last year produced a surge of populist xenophobic parties. Many explanations have been given: the economic crisis, unemployment, the disenfranchisement of the middle classes, anxieties fed by globalisation. Pointing fingers at strangers or supposed intruders has become almost an automatic reflex. Anti-immigration parties are having a field day. All our problems come from the outside, from some kind of invasion: that’s how the narrative goes. In France the novelist Michel Houellebecq is making headlines with a new book imagining the election in 2022 of a Muslim president.  &#10;&#10;There are, it is true, signs of a democratic revival against racism. In solidarity with Muslims, some citizens have been demonstrating in European cities. It is perhaps only when the worst happens – arson attacks on mosques, or neo-Nazi groups in the streets – that people start mobilising for common decency. But the trend is worrisome indeed. Europeans seem to be grappling with this one question: how do I live alongside people of a different cultural background, the Other?  &#10;&#10;In times like this, literature and history can help us see things more clearly. I turned to the Polish writer Ryszard Kapuściński, who spent most of his life travelling across the developing world and reflecting on how Europeans relate to that huge part of the global population that is non- European, and much poorer than Europeans.  &#10;&#10;In his book The Other, Kapuściński – who had flaws as a journalist, but certainly didn’t lack curiosity for different cultures – points out how difficult it is for inhabitants of the old continent to accept that “the map of the world has changed” since decolonisation in the 1960s. After dominating the globe for hundreds of years, Europeans still have trouble dealing with the fact that they have become less central, less overpowering. And yet it is a paradox, because Europe produced arguably the first world citizen open to discovering and appreciating foreign cultures: the Greek historian Herodotus, 2,500 years ago.  &#10;&#10;I can hear the cringing: how delusional and idealistic it is to bring Herodotus into a 21st-century debate on immigration. But if roots matter, then Europeans must look at themselves more closely. Things were never stable, nor populations fixed in stone. Europe is after all the appendix of a great and contrasted landmass – it was always meant to be a crossroads. We may be baffled by changes, but there were times when we lived with much more diversity in our midst.  &#10;&#10;Tony Judt is great to read on this. In his book Postwar, he recalls how “the European continent was once a complex tapestry of languages, religions, communities, and nations that overlapped. Many of its cities – including some of the smallest, at the intersection of old and new imperial borders, such as Trieste, Sarajevo, Salonica, Czernowitz, Odessa, Vilnius – were truly multicultural, with Catholics, Orthodox, Muslims, Jews and others mingling.”  &#10;&#10;Judt goes on: “Between 1914 and 1945, however, this Europe was reduced to ashes.” As a result of war, occupation, border changes, expulsions and genocide, most people ended up living among people like them, in different states. During the cold war, the two halves of Europe lived in “hermetic national enclaves” – a world of homogeneity, notes Judt.  &#10;&#10;In the 1960s immigrants arrived in western Europe to provide a workforce, most from former colonies. Judt calls this a “new presence of ‘others’ living in Europe”, including the millions of Muslims in today’s EU. He says this presence “has outlined not only Europe’s discomfort as it is faced with a renewed and growing diversity, but also the ease with which the ‘other’ dead of Europe’s past had crept out of people’s minds”. So there it is: today’s intolerance has its roots not just in economic frustration, but in amnesia.  &#10;&#10;Since 1989 many of Europe’s centres have become “cosmopolitan global cities, whether they like it or not”, writes Judt. Note the “whether they like it or not”. This book was published 10 years ago, as if in anticipation of what we see today. The historian’s message is that Europe’s future is multicultural. Its core values are about being open to the Other. The only time Europeans experienced relative demographic homogeneity – that era of supposed tranquillity – was in the wake of Hitler’s and Stalin’s devastations. Such thoughts might not be enough to calm the anti-Muslim crowds. But they could help.  	Natalie Nougayrède: Anti-Muslim protesters should heed the past century’s grim history – and its lesson that Europe’s future must be multicultural
012-anotherclimatechangesummitd	aljazeera	Wed, 03 Dec 2014 02:16:47 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/another-climate-change-summit-d-201412313583380944.html	Kumi Naidoo	Another climate change summit: Don't give up	Many have simply lost faith in global climate negotiations summits such as COP 20 starting in Lima, Peru today. But while the process has not delivered the climate action we need, I would argue that this year key things have changed and that we must continue to demand from our politicians that they listen and act and, by that, safeguard the future of next and current generations on this planet.  &#10;&#10;As nations start the latest global round of climate change negotiations in Lima, Peru today, it is easy to be cynical. Because in the 20 plus years that our governments have been meeting for global climate meetings, emissions have risen more than ever before. This year is already predicted to be the warmest since records began.  &#10;&#10;And yet, this is a moment of opportunity. Because things are changing, really changing. In the climate movement, in the economy and in the politics of climate change. Today, the climate movement all over the world is reenergised. The largest ever climate march in New York this September was a powerful symbol for the global rise of a movement that is stopping pipelines and coal plants as well as forcing renewable energy solutions all over the world.  &#10;&#10;In economics, too, we live in a different world: Cost-effective, sensible renewable energy solutions have made quantum leaps. Renewables are the most economical solution for new power capacity in an ever-increasing number of countries. One hundred percent of new power capacity added in the United States in August was renewable and countries such as Denmark and Germany are producing new "clean electricity" records almost every month. China is installing as much solar this year as the US has ever done.  &#10;&#10;Bilateral agreement  &#10;&#10;The recent bilateral agreement between China and the United States to cut pollution and drive cleaner energy sources is, in addition, a sign of changing politics. Many said that such an agreement was impossible, that it would not happen in our lifetimes. And yet it did. Only a fool would argue that the action proposed by these two biggest polluters and biggest economies is enough.  &#10;&#10;It is not enough, experts have already told us, to protect our planet from a potential three or four degree Celsius rise in global temperatures - with all the disastrous consequences that would have for us, our children, and our ecosystems.  &#10;&#10;But the fact that the world's biggest emitters have come together moves us from a "you go first" mentality, that had paralysed global climate negotiations for years, to an "I will act if you will act" frame. At Lima, others must now follow and our pressure must speed up the action.  &#10;&#10;Because we need an agreement to tackle the climate crisis, which meets the needs of the many not the few. Because it is ordinary people living in flood and drought prone areas, dependent for their livelihoods on fishing, farming and forests, or living in cities engulfed by pollution or in housing that cannot protect them from storms or heat waves, who are bearing the brunt of our experiment with the world's climate.  &#10;&#10;The United Nations - where every country has a voice, not matter how small, relatively poor or vulnerable - are still the only place where we can hope to secure action that takes full account of these peoples' rights.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;At Lima, we need governments to make sure that the direction is right. They need to agree a goal of ending carbon pollution and deliver renewable energy for all people on this planet by 2050. And in Lima, governments must agree to renew and review their targets every five years, starting in 2025.  &#10;&#10;Not just to cut pollution, but to help the vulnerable adapt to climate change, and to support poorer countries to provide sustainable energy access for their populations.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;Every government should already be preparing their "intended nationally determined contribution" - their offer towards the Paris deal. Before March 2015 we must see concrete, ambitious plans from each and every one of the world's polluting nations - to phase out coal and nuclear power, to install solar and wind energy, to increase energy efficiency, to build cleaner and more livable cities, and to protect forests.  &#10;&#10;In Lima, governments must agree to review whether these plans are enough to prevent climate chaos and whether the effort is shared fairly between richer and poorer nations before they meet again in Paris in December 2015.  &#10;&#10;In Lima, we expect scientists, business people and investors, city mayors, faith leaders and civil society organisations from all over the world to be calling for more ambitious climate action. The climate movement gets broader and more effective day. It is an unstoppable force now - and in Lima and Paris, we will make our voices heard.  	The fact that the world's biggest emitters have come together takes us beyond&#10;the 'you go first' mentality.&#10;&#10;
013-anxiousbritainsuccourtvleadere	guardian	2015-01-12T07:00:01Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/12/anxious-britain-succour-tv-leader-election-debate	Zoe Williams	Anxious Britain will find no succour in a TV election debate	The prospect of the television election debates elicits from me two incompatible responses. On the one hand, I believe strongly that the Greens should be invited. If it’s on the basis of having a seat in the house, then they have the same right as Ukip. If it’s on the grounds of polling, they have a stronger claim than the Liberal Democrats. If it’s on the basis of who Ofcom thinks is a good chap, then Ofcom needs to have a word with itself. I have mild views on how much of a psephological impact the debates have in the first place (some), and whether it constitutes a democratic deficit not to have them (no).  &#10;&#10;On the other hand, I know how these debates will unfold, if indeed they do: much like a mud wrestle, without the energy, or any prospect of a winner. This election has already turned “debate” into a series of “dids!” and “didn’ts!”. “You caused the crash.” “Didn’t.” “Did.” “We reduced the deficit.” “Didn’t.” “Did.” It is beneath them to perform it, and certainly beneath us all to watch.  &#10;&#10;Once, finding nothing attractive forthcoming in the political offering, we could turn away to apathy. That was the boom-time option. The idea that politicians are identical, and all we’ve got, once induced a comfortable stupor: now it feels like an anxiety dream.  &#10;&#10;Something’s Not Right: Insecurity and an Anxious Nation is a report published today by Compass as an overview of the economic situation in which most people find themselves. Its author, Michael Orton, describes a 20-75-5 nation: there’s an intractable fifth of people in poverty, and an unaffected elite numbering approximately 5%, which has held since the 1990s. The difference is that vast space in between, three-quarters of people, who are now beset by named and nameless fears.  &#10;&#10;There are concrete worries about debt, wages, childcare, food, energy and the impossibility of ever being a homeowner, or the inevitability of rent increases for the tenant with no options. To all this is added less measurable, longer-term anxieties: that workplace security is getting weaker, that whatever is bad now will be worse for the next generation; that the new scale of indebtedness, gargantuan mortgages for those who can get them, student debts running to billions, will result in a new kind of servitude – but to whom? The problem with the status quo, an anti-corporate campaigner said to me once, is that it’s not static. It’s getting worse.  &#10;&#10;Not one of these fears could ever be called unreasonable – the numbers are in. We are clear that real median hourly wages have gone down by 10.2 percent and are now lower than they were in 1997. People on average incomes are at a greater danger of falling into debt than the unemployed. We are now pursuing what Orton calls “a high living cost, low income, high debt, low savings approach”. It’s rather tactful to call this an “approach”. “Hurtling off a cliff” would work just as well.  &#10;&#10;The prevalence of anxiety as a condition of modern life is undisputed: according to the Office of National Statistics, 20% of people rate their level of anxiety as six or more out of 10, at any one time. As many as one in three will suffer from panic attacks at some point in their life. The suggested solutions are usually a triangulation of exercise, drugs and cognitive behavioural therapy. In England last year, 40m prescriptions were issued for antidepressants (which includes anti-anxiety drugs). CBT and exercise have their disciples, but clearly aren’t panaceas.  &#10;&#10;There is no shortage of people – psychologists, sociologists, doctors – looking beyond the frailties of the human mind for wider causes. It is commonplace to cite consumerism and its attendant evils of working too hard to fund it, and missing the things that are important, while you work – and yet however social the problem, the suggested solutions are always individual. Stop wanting things; stop spending; prioritise; downsize; take stock. You can’t control the world, so try controlling your negative response to it.  &#10;&#10;It is also commonplace, T-shirt-sloganly common, to say that to be anxious is nothing more than a rational response to precarious conditions; but what will it take for us to build that into a set of political demands, rather than try to interrogate them away with introspection and positive self-talk?  &#10;&#10;At the start of a panic attack, you are supposed to commence the catechism: what am I afraid of? How likely is it to happen? Can I do anything to prevent its happening? This questionnaire was devised as a balm, but what if the answers are “I’m afraid that life will continue to be as hard as it is right now, for my entire life, and be worse for my children.” “I’m afraid this is extremely likely.” “I could do everything about it; just not on my own.” What then? Will the leadership debates take on a new piquancy when politics suddenly looks like the only answer?  &#10;&#10;Norman Tebbit told the Observer that we were going into the “most awful election campaign that anyone can remember”. His answer was bread and circuses: “The public enjoy confrontations,” he said. It’s so wrong, it’s intoxicating. We have taken confrontation, and sometimes enjoyed it, in lieu of a politics that has anything to say about lives as they are mostly lived. But it’s gone on long enough.

014-areelectedlnpwithoutcampbellne	guardian	2015-01-06T05:45:34Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/06/a-re-elected-lnp-without-campbell-newman-could-this-be-the-election-that-returns-queensland-to-normality	Ben Raue	A re-elected LNP without Campbell Newman: could this be the election that returns Queensland to normality?	Campbell Newman’s LNP government won power in 2012 in a huge landslide – and polls suggest that most of those gains are expected to be swept away as Queensland politics returns to normality.  &#10;&#10;In 2012, the sitting Labor government’s seats in the parliament were cut savagely from 51 to seven. The LNP opposition increased their seats from 34 to 78. In the new parliament, there were seven government members for every member of the opposition and crossbench.  &#10;&#10;Since 2012, the LNP has lost two seats to Labor at by-elections, and three other MPs elected for the LNP now sit on the crossbench. Despite these changes, the LNP has a massive majority and a large swing will be required for a change in government.  &#10;&#10;Because of the huge swing in 2012, it’s hard to predict which seats will be the key battlegrounds. In a normal election campaign, you would look first at the seats held by the government by the smallest margins (those seats they came closest to losing at the previous election).  &#10;&#10;Yet in Queensland, most LNP seats on slim margins are seats traditionally considered to be “safe” Labor seats – if Labor has any chance of taking power, you would expect those seats to fall easily and the election to focus on seats further along the pendulum.  &#10;&#10;At the last election, it was estimated that the LNP won 62.8% of the vote after preferences. Recent polls indicate there has been a large swing back to Labor. The most recent Newspoll had Labor and the LNP tied on 50% each.  &#10;&#10;These polls suggest that Labor is in with a chance of winning the election, despite the massive number of seats they need to gain. In order to ward off this threat, the LNP will likely need to sacrifice many of its seats in order to focus energy on those seats they can retain.  &#10;&#10;Labor needs a uniform swing of approximately 12.5% to win the 36 extra seats they need to win a majority. Current polling suggests that Labor is close to that number, and this suggests that most of the seats that will be key battlegrounds are seats the LNP now holds by margins of 10-15%, but there will be seats that swing more or less than the average.  &#10;&#10;If you focus on those with margins of between 10% and 15%, there are a smattering of seats in Brisbane, as well as four seats on the Gold Coast, one on the Sunshine Coast, one in Townsville and two rural seats near Mackay.  &#10;&#10;In addition, the LNP will be fighting on another front against populist and right-wing independents and minor parties. The Palmer United Party and Katter’s Australian Party will both be running hard. KAP now holds three seats, and there are four independents in the Parliament.  &#10;&#10;While many seats will be in play, Ashgrove in northern Brisbane – Campbell Newman’s seat – is likely to be the focus of the campaign.  &#10;&#10;The premier won the seat off Kate Jones in 2012. Newman had never held a seat in parliament before winning power in 2012 – he made his name as lord mayor of Brisbane. Jones had been a minister in the Bligh government, and was a high- profile target.  &#10;&#10;In 2012, Newman won Ashgrove with a 12.8% swing, but holds the seat by a margin of only 5.7% – half as big as the expected Labor swing. Local polling suggests that Newman is trailing in local Ashgrove polls behind Jones, who is aiming to win back her former seat.  &#10;&#10;If Newman is seen to be in danger of losing his seat, his party’s campaign may struggle to answer questions about who would lead a re-elected LNP government. With Labor needing 5.7% to win Ashgrove, and 12.5% to win the overall election, it’s entirely conceivable that the government could be re-elected without Newman in the lead. That scenario may help Labor reach the vote it needs to win back power.  	As Campbell Newman announces an early summer election, polls suggest Labor is in with a chance to win. The LNP will have to make sacrifices to retain government
015-areyoudrinkingbecauseyourework	guardian	2015-01-20T06:14:28Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/20/are-you-drinking-because-youre-working-long-hours-or-are-you-working-long-hours-to-justify-drinking	Van Badham	Are you drinking because you're working long hours, or are you working long hours to justify drinking?	An international study released last week has identified that those who work more than 48 hours a week are 11% more likely to drink alcohol at risk levels than those working a standard week.  &#10;&#10;The study was compiled by Finnish researchers, sampling 300,000 subjects across Europe, Australia and North America. Health guidelines suggest that consumption of more than 14 drinks a week for women and 21 drinks for men poses a significant health risk.  &#10;&#10;It’s no surprise that it’s a team of Finnish researchers who are examining the stats around unsafe drinking. Nordic Finland may be a well-known haven of progressive social policy, with an enviable living standard, cradle-to-grave welfare and the world’s best education system, but there is one social problem the Finns have not yet licked. Alcohol-related illnesses and incidents (including accidents, violence and suicide in which alcohol has factored) are the most common cause of death for both working age men and women there – and have been so for many years.  &#10;&#10;The study is of useful consideration for Australians, of course – we’re afflicted with alcohol problems of our own. Australian research released only last July revealed up to 15 people die and more than 430 are admitted to hospital every day in Australia for alcohol-related reasons. That’s 5,554 deaths and 157,132 hospital admissions a year, and four times the rate of the road toll.  &#10;&#10;That working longer hours has a detrimental effect on an individual’s health is well established. Some have suggested from the results of the Finnish study that alcohol abuse is symptomatic of the “work hard, play hard” cultures around professions – especially because workers who shifted into longer-hours jobs during the study were 12% more likely to develop risky drinking habits as a result.  &#10;&#10;Some have also suggested that the scarcity of leisure time for people who work long hours may result in habits of using alcohol as a concentrated form of relaxant. This is the opinion of Cassandra A. Okechukwu, assistant professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who declared of the Finnish findings that “people are self-medicating” due to work-life time constraints.  &#10;&#10;Alternatively, Dr Richard Wise, psychologist at Windana Drug and Alcohol Recovery, believes the relationship between work and drinking may be bi- directional. “As stress increases the activity of brain regions responsible for drug seeking and craving, stressful work is often ‘addictive’ in itself,” says Wise. “This could be a self-perpetuating cycle – work causes stress, which renders people more prone to addictions to substances and work.”  &#10;&#10;Significantly, the study itself does not claim to prove a causation – leaving open the possibility to discuss the pink elephant that lurks in the room behind all social discussions of problem drinking: the prevalent, if sometimes well-camouflaged, existence of actual alcoholics.  &#10;&#10;Writing in Business Insider, journalist Kevin Loria asked of the study: “Long hours may not cause dangerous drinking, but why is there a relationship between those two things at all?” The answer is this: there is not one clear relationship, but potentially several. We know, for example, that those suffering active alcoholism seek out environments that facilitate and camouflage their drinking. Why would the workplace be an exception?  &#10;&#10;Demanding jobs not only deliver alcoholics out of the worksite just in time for socially-acceptable drinking hours, but the stresses associated with long- hours work provide pretexts aplenty for “self-medicating” with booze. Our community continues to excuse the practise of drowning one’s sorrows, but forgotten is that active alcoholics often go looking for sorrows in order to drown them.  &#10;&#10;The recovery community calls this phenomenon “drinking on it” – it’s not hard to find a pretext to slam down some craved-for cold ones at the end of the day if you’ve just spent 10 hours at a desk. And if there’s one thing an alcoholic can use to deny the extent of their drinking, it’s the company of others who share the same problem. The common logic of alcohol addiction brings alcoholics together in work environments as much as it does social ones.  &#10;&#10;Yet while study after study identifies alcohol as a health, economic and justice burden on the community, and with the statistical acknowledgement that 3.7 million Australians are currently “drinking at long-term risky levels”, we’re still – still – struggling to break our social addiction to the old stereotypes of alcoholics being weak-willed, staggering hobos rather than predominantly people with jobs, relationships and families who are sick with a dangerous medical problem. If we choose to believe someone is drinking because they work long hours, we may be ignoring that someone is working long hours because it enables their drinking.  &#10;&#10;A failure to identify behaviours symptomatic with alcoholism delays treatment and increases the danger alcoholics pose to themselves and to others. Go back and look at the figures above: 5,500+ deaths and 150,000+ hospital admissions a year are not the result of mere casual tipples. They’re the stats of widespread abuse that needs more than loose causation and euphemisms to treat it.  &#10;&#10;The Finnish study is valuable because it identifies a possible workplace component to the alcohol problem. With 3.7 million Australians presently at risk, the time is now to be realistic that a broader context of alcoholism exists.  	A new study finds a link between working long hours and drinking alcohol at risky levels, but it might not be as simple as it seems

(AP Photo/Jason DeCrow) (The Associated Press)  &#10;&#10;Tomas Mamani, of La Paz, Bolivia, looks at his camera after taking a photo outside United Nations headquarters, Monday, Sept. 22, 2014. The World Conference on Indigenous Peoples began Monday at the U.N. (AP Photo/Jason DeCrow) (The Associated Press)  &#10;&#10;Defaulting on sovereign debt is never a good strategy. Just ask Argentina. The South American nation has defaulted 10 times—most recently this summer—on its international obligations and has experienced sharp economic decline as a result. In the early 1900s, Argentina ranked among the world’s top 10 in per capita income. By 2012, it had fallen to 55th.  &#10;&#10;Rather than learn anything from this unhappy history, however, Argentina is opting for stubbornness, bullying and intimidation of its debt-holders, all with a helping hand from the United Nations, as it refuses to pay back bondholders for billions of dollars.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;What Argentina wants is to establish “a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes.” Such a multilateral endeavor -- established, run, and funded by governments -- will no doubt be more sympathetic to financial deadbeats like Argentina than a U.S. court that has to give equal standing to the private sector.  &#10;&#10;It’s also the kind of thing that the United Nations loves to endorse: high- minded and technical sounding, larded with ostensible respect for international legal processes, and standing above any single national interest—with absolutely no chance whatsoever that it will be any of these things.  &#10;&#10;Sure enough, Argentina has successfully rallied a majority of U.N. member nations to join in denouncing Argentina’s debt holders and endorsing its multilateral debt restructuring framework. This September the U.N. General Assembly voted 124-11, with 41 abstentions, to support Argentina’s position.  &#10;&#10;The U.N. Human Rights Council soon followed suit, adopting a similar resolution 33-5, with 9 abstentions. The notorious Council, which includes some of the world’s worst human rights violators in its membership, got involved because it says excessive debt is an impediment to full realization of “social, economic and cultural” rights.  &#10;&#10;It is certainly true that debt defaults take a huge toll because the defaulting country loses access to international financial markets and foreign exchange, limiting its ability to finance expenditures and obligations and pay for imported goods. The end result is typically sharp recession and rising unemployment. But Argentina’s latest default is is different from earlier defaults, which were driven by economic crises. The 2014 crisis, though rooted in a previous $100 billion default that occurred 13 years ago, is a deliberate—and unnecessary—choice of the Argentine government.  &#10;&#10;In 2005 and 2010, Argentina offered to exchange bonds that it had defaulted on at about 35 cents on the dollar. Eventually, about 93 percent of debt holders agreed to the swap. Some debt holders, however, held out and went to U.S. court arguing that Argentina had to pay them the full value of their bonds. In 2012, a U.S. judge ruled in their favor and further ruled that any financial institution that assisted in partial payment would be in contempt.  &#10;&#10;Following the court’s ruling, Argentina could have complied or at least paid interest on the bonds while trying to renegotiate a more favorable debt arrangement. Instead, this summer it decided to pay nothing, abandon negotiations, and rely on demagoguery to press its case in the court of public opinion.  &#10;&#10;Argentina has denounced its debt holders—shrilly and often—as “vulture” funds. Of course, it never mentions that it was Argentina that voluntarily issued the debt in the first place, presumably in good faith. Nor does it acknowledge that the government’s own reckless economic policies precipitated the debt crisis in the first place.  &#10;&#10;If you think that sort of dishonest name-calling would fall on deaf ears, you don’t know the United Nations. Argentina’s success in rallying a majority of U.N. member nations to join in denouncing the debt holders results from an underlying fact. At the U.N. the agenda of many developing nations consists of blaming others for the consequences their poor economic choices and demanding that the developed nations provide more aid, less accountability for money already given, and no right to object when feckless countries misbehave.  &#10;&#10;The U.N. resolutions in support of Argentina do not have the force of law. But the intended goal is clearly to establish a “a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes” via a treaty or international convention. Historically, U.N. resolutions are the first step in this process.  &#10;&#10;That is clearly the hope of Hector Timerman, Argentina’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, who made clear why his country had pressed so hard to get the resolutions. “Vulture funds will not stop until we put the brake on…,” he declared. “The resolution not only condemns vulture’s activities, but also urges the UN to investigate their behavior and analyze their effect over sovereign economies.”  &#10;&#10;In other words, he is arguing: Let’s point the finger at someone else to avoid responsibility for our own economic failings.  &#10;&#10;As the U.S. made clear in its statement opposing the effort, if the terms of debt obligations are subject to review, renegotiation, or negation by a government as it feels like it, the cost of lending to everyone will rise to meet the perceived risk. Indeed many countries may find it impossible to access international capital markets at all. And many of the countries hardest hit will be a lot poorer than Argentina, a middle income country that has never learned to live within its means.  &#10;&#10;U.N.-endorsed demagoguery is no way to resolve a problem of habitual economic and fiscal incompetence. Unfortunately, however, it may be an effective means for seducing other countries to join Argentina in the misery of being a financial pariah.

017-argentinagrowthatwhatprice	aljazeera	Fri, 12 Dec 2014 12:47:09 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/argentina-growth-at-what-price-2014121211341048195.html	Claudia Ricca	Argentina: Growth at what price?	Argentina has chosen a certain path for development that is diametrically opposed to what is required to mitigate the problems of climate change. And as Argentinean representatives attend the Climate Change Summit in Peru, it’s worth looking at its poor environmental record.  &#10;&#10;Average temperature in the southern region of Patagonia has increased one degree Celsius in the last 50 years, provoking the retreat of the largest glaciers in the region. During the same period, rains increased by 10 percent in the east; severe flooding in northeastern Argentina has been linked to the change in the use of the land and the deterioration of local ecosystems. In addition, the country has suffered from increased sea levels, reduction in fresh water bodies, desertification, severe storms and tornadoes.  &#10;&#10;Argentina has a rate of deforestation of 0.8 percent per year - twice that of the Amazon region, or about 26 hectares per hour. Despite the Forest Act coming into force in February 2009, over one million hectares of native woods were destroyed between 2009 and 2012. The Forest Act budget for 2015 has been set at just 300 million pesos ($27m) instead of the 3.1 billion pesos ($364m) as requested by environmental activists. The national government has consistently failed to properly fund the implementation of the Forest Act, making it completely ineffective  &#10;&#10;Local governments continue to authorise the deforestation of protected woods at the request of local landowners, generating a serious environmental impact, the displacement of indigenous and peasant populations and the persecution of environmental activists  &#10;&#10;While high temperatures continue to push the consumption of electricity to record levels and demand for electricity is set to grow at an average of 5.5 percent per year, Argentina is far from achieving its target of 8 percent renewable energy generation by 2016. In 2013, investment for smaller scale hydro clean energy fell 70 percent from $2.7bn to just $153m. At the end of 2012, only 1.4 percent of all electricity produced was from renewable resources.  &#10;&#10;Meanwhile in 2013, the Supreme Court lifted an embargo on Chevron's assets in Argentina, so it could enter into an agreement to exploit the shale gas site at Vaca Muerta, in the province of Neuquen. Chevron, which has been condemned by courts in Ecuador for environmental damage, has pledged $1.5bn to develop it. Each of the 1,500 planned fracking wells will use up to 12 million litres of water. The Mapuche indigenous communities living nearby oppose the development as it will increase contamination of their subterranean water supply.  &#10;&#10;Argentina is the third largest producer of soy after the US and Brazil, exporting practically all of its production to Europe and China and providing much needed revenue for the government at a time when it faces increased demands to pay its external debts.  &#10;&#10;The use of soy for biofuels has promoted deforestation and its expansion has generated enormous greenhouse gas emissions due to the loss of forest mass and the changes in the use of the land.  &#10;&#10;Thanks to a reduction in the taxation of biofuel exports and other tax incentives, the production of biodiesel reached a historical record in September 2014, totalling nearly 1.9m tonnes in the first nine months of 2014. In the last few years, the area for maize cultivation for biofuel has increased. Greenpeace points out that corn-based bioethanol has an extremely poor energetic balance, while civil society organisations question the use of agricultural land to produce grains to feed machines rather than people.  &#10;&#10;Still, there are signs of hope. On December 3, the Argentinean Senate approved tax incentives for the generation of electricity from renewable energy sources. The Chamber of Deputies is likely to make it law next year. But in light of Argentina's environmental record, there is clearly a lot of work yet to be done and many more laws and policies to be implemented.

Much of this reliance on Russia stems from essential security and economic concerns.  &#10;&#10;Armenia's security reliance on Russia is driven by a virtual state of war with neighbouring Azerbaijan, rooted in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, only exacerbated by the absence of "normal" diplomatic relations and closed border with Turkey. And with the Turkish refusal to recognise the Armenian genocide, this threat perception is only magnified.  &#10;&#10;For small, landlocked Armenia, a strategic alliance with Russia is generally accepted as essential in the face of such inherent insecurity. And beyond an imperative of security, Armenia also depends on Russia as a crucial source of remittances, or money sent home by large numbers of Armenians living and working in Russia.  &#10;&#10;Yet, there is a surprisingly intense debate now under way within Armenia that seriously questions these fundamental pillars of the Armenian-Russian relationship.  &#10;&#10;New challenge  &#10;&#10;More specifically, this new challenge to Armenia's traditional reliance on Russia is driven by two significant factors: tragedy and timing.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;A tragedy first triggered this turnabout when a rogue Russian soldier killed an entire Armenian family, save for a six-month-old infant who later died of his stab wounds, in Gyumri, Armenia.  &#10;&#10;Gyumri is the country's second-largest city and the host of the Russian military base.  &#10;&#10;That senseless act of random violence in the early morning hours of January 12, sparked an immediate and spontaneous outpouring of grief and mourning.  &#10;&#10;But the initial shock and grief quickly turned to outrage, as Russian military officials seemed to take charge of the case with a heavy-handed disdain and disregard for local sensitivities.  &#10;&#10;That perception was only deepened when Armenian officials were slow to respond or react.  &#10;&#10;It was this mishandling of the tragedy, even more than the murder itself, that then triggered a series of demonstrations and protests by local Armenians in Gyumri.  &#10;&#10;Fearing that the Russian conscript would be moved from his detention within the Russian base and likely returned to Moscow, local residents demanded that the self-confessed soldier be turned over to Armenian authorities.  &#10;&#10;Calming tensions  &#10;&#10;For its part, local Armenian officials and the prosecutor general scurried to calm tensions by first announcing that Armenian investigators were actively participating in the interrogation of the soldier, and then, once that did little to appease the protesters, vowed that the soldier would be tried in Armenia.  &#10;&#10;Amid the Armenian officials' wrangling over the legal process of the case, the absence of any higher level Armenian officials, and the failure of the Armenian president to declare a day of mourning or even make a statement, only escalated the tension.  &#10;&#10;And days later, no Armenian official attended the funeral of the murdered family, thereby triggering a fresh wave of indignant protests in the city, that later spread to the capital, Yerevan. The protests soon moved to the Russian consulate in Gyumri before culminating in a march on the Russian base as protesters broke through a police cordon to enter the base itself.  &#10;&#10;Yet, there is a deeper context to this public anger. In fact, that family is only the latest victim in murders and shootings by Russian servicemen stationed at the Russian military base.  &#10;&#10;In 1999, two drunk Russian soldiers opened fire on a local market in the city, killing two and injuring dozens of others. And in 2013, two children were killed by unexploded ordnance on an unguarded tank firing range on the premises of the Russian base.  &#10;&#10;Bad timing  &#10;&#10;Against this backdrop, the tragedy has also raised renewed questions of base security, with outrage that the armed soldier who reportedly deserted his post triggered no notice or alarm by Russian military personnel at the base.  &#10;&#10;Although this tragedy has prompted a new challenge to Armenian-Russian relations, it is also exacerbated by a second factor, timing.  &#10;&#10;The timing of this tragedy could not be much worse, for several reasons. First, in 2013, in what many perceived as Russian pressure on its so-called "strategic partner", Armenia was forced to scrap its planned free trade deal with the European Union in favour of joining the Russian-led Eurasian Union.  &#10;&#10;Second, a steady supply of arms and advanced weapons systems to Azerbaijan from Russia has sowed further distrust.  &#10;&#10;And most recently, the negative impact on the Armenian economy from western sanctions imposed on Russia, evident in a sudden depreciation of the Armenian currency and reflected in a steep decline in remittances, has only revealed the asymmetry and lack of parity in Armenia's "partnership" with Russia.  &#10;&#10;It seems clear that this unexpected challenge to Armenia's reliance on Russia will not dissipate any time soon.  	Slaying of Armenian family by a Russian soldier spurs intense debate over&#10;Armenia's security relationship with Russia.&#10;&#10;

In spite of many pitfalls, sometimes big, Muslims succeeded in building a civilisation that upheld universal human values, blended with the Islamic principles of pluralism.  &#10;&#10;Unpleasant state of affairs  &#10;&#10;But, with an increasing knowledge deficit over centuries, the Muslim social and spiritual capitals were dwindling. As their individual life was losing the spark of faith and positive action, their public life or political leadership was taken over by people of lower moral clarity and spiritual strength.  &#10;&#10;Much of the world of Islam is now riddled with political strangulation, economic mismanagement and social division. The post-colonial breed of corrupt, incompetent and often repressive rulers - having little regard for the ordinary people and their human rights or respect for the rule of law - have made their countries ungovernable. Some are no better than the Soviet-era communist rulers.  &#10;&#10;Failed politics has widened the rift between political camps, particularly between secularists and Islamists, in some countries. This has worsened the social divide, with increased intolerance and violence. All this is impacting negatively on the nascent Muslim minority communities in the West.  &#10;&#10;The collapse of politics in Iraq and Syria in recent years set off a ruthless proxy war in these historic lands, with the destruction of infrastructure and an unprecedented refugee crisis.  &#10;&#10;The rise of ISIL and its alluring attraction of young recruits from around the world, including from Muslim minority countries, has raised global Islamophobia to a new level.  &#10;&#10;Politicians are meant to act in the interests of their people. It is not only their civic duty but for a Muslim politician it is their Islamic obligation as well. No matter what their background is, they should work with fellow politicians with grace and a team ethos - as co-citizens and co-religionists, not as enemies to one another.  &#10;&#10;This is not too big of a demand in the 21st century.  &#10;&#10;The overwhelming majority of Muslims across the world are ordinary hardworking people, with love for their land and religion. They hate extremism and violence, whether political or religious. They expect some competency and humility from their social and political leaders.  &#10;&#10;A call for a truce between opposing political forces  &#10;&#10;But in much of the Muslim world this is not the case presently; politics has become an Achilles' heel. This legacy may go back to their dark days under colonial "divide and rule", but this can no longer be an excuse. It is shocking that some Arab countries have degenerated into bloodletting between people of the same history and religion that made them great.  &#10;&#10;They are on the verge of regressing to the days of pre-Islamic "jahiliya" (ignorance). Aside from the influence of unhelpful global politics, the root cause lies in the failure of their own political and religious leaders.  &#10;&#10;Unless Muslim politicians and civic leaders come to their senses and adopt people-oriented principled politics, improve their accountability and regard themselves as people's servants, the situation is going to get worse.  &#10;&#10;The current blame game is meaningless.  &#10;&#10;Politicians do have a higher degree of responsibility to bring a nation out of the political mess, but one should not forget that they originate from the society and carry its values, norms and culture. The whole society must now come to its senses and stand up against this self-annihilation.  &#10;&#10;The bloodletting between diehard secularists and inexperienced hard-line Islamists in some countries is a boon to entrenched dictators to dig their heels and hegemonic powers to milk national wealth.  &#10;&#10;Islam is indeed very broad and has the ability to accommodate anyone and everyone. So, the difference between a Muslim secularist and an Islamist is a matter of degree. This is being blown up by people of ulterior motives and must be challenged.  &#10;&#10;Secularists have been in power in much of the Muslim world for decades and they do not want to bow out without a fight. Islamists want to unseat them, but lack the political experience in running the affairs of modern statecraft. Behind the furore, a democratic deficit and lack of confidence are big issues for many politicians.  &#10;&#10;The demons must be slain. Wise individuals, senior citizens and authoritative institutions should raise their voice of sanity and help set the national conversation among politicians.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;Secularists should accept the social reality that there are Islamists in their midst; on the other hand, Islamists will also do better if they recognise that secularism is part of modern reality.  &#10;&#10;Both groups consist of human beings and cannot be exterminated.  &#10;&#10;'Live and let live'  &#10;&#10;There is no short-cut to end the chronic and acute political crisis in the Muslim world. But it is vital all political groups work on the basis of existing socio-political realities and find ways to reconcile with the principle of "live and let live".  &#10;&#10;Sensible and moderate people from various political camps should sit together, informally and formally, and find a pragmatic political framework to make democratic politics institutional and allow healthy transition of power.  &#10;&#10;Every citizen has a right to rule.  &#10;&#10;The long awaited Arab Spring and its failure in most countries have made things worse. However, it has also left powerful legacy and lessons. The failure in Egypt and ongoing experiment in Tunisia are too vivid to ignore.  &#10;&#10;The nobility in politics lies in bringing happiness to people's lives, peace in society and raising the dignity of a people. Muslim politicians would do better if they keep in mind their Prophet's timeless statement: "A leader of a people is their servant."  &#10;&#10;The world of Islam is at a crossroad, either to make or break. There are plenty of talented and visionary people with personal integrity in Muslim societies who should now come to politics and make a serious effort to cleanse it from the dirt.  &#10;&#10;Let there arise a new breed of Muslim politicians who have the steel and skill of turning anarchy into optimism.  	Muslims must defy corrupt politics and social divisions to emerge from the&#10;crises that plague the Muslim world.&#10;&#10;

The country's heritage is being dug up, stolen or blasted to smithereens and the most effective armed groups in the country, whether ISIL or Hezbollah on the ground or Israel and US in the air, operate under flags that are not Syria's own.  &#10;&#10;Syria has become a stage for a plethora of violent actors and at the centre is the seemingly immovable object of President Bashar al-Assad, the 49-year-old who has been in power since 2000 following three decades of his father's rule.  &#10;&#10;The brutal events in Paris have sparked another conversation across global media on the scourge of Islamic terrorism and led the Independent's Middle East correspondent, Patrick Cockburn, to suggest that people forget about overthrowing Assad and instead should concentrate on building a common cause with Damascus that "could unite against violent Sunni jihadism".  &#10;&#10;However, while Assad is still there nominally in power, a closer look reveals that he is more marginalised than ever and an increasingly irrelevant political actor on a stage dominated by others. This authoritarian facade must be taken into account in future policy towards the beleaguered country.  &#10;&#10;Start by asking the question; what is Assad still president of? Half of the country have fled their homes, over 200,000 are dead and a million are wounded. The UN estimates that it will cost $8.4bn in 2015 to look after Syrians affected by war and more than 6,500 cases of typhoid and 4,200 cases of measles were reported in 2014.  &#10;&#10;Although "government forces" are supposedly in control of some 50 percent of the territory the devolution of power to militias as well as Iranian and Hezbollah forces means that Assad's command and control is stretched like never before.  &#10;&#10;Meanwhile in the east, ISIL runs a bus network out if its capital Raqqa and despite Kobane being in stalemate, the Kurds are increasingly sketching out the makings of a statelet in the northeast of the country.  &#10;&#10;The country's borders are disappearing as functional entities with talk of a Turkish buffer zone in the north and all sorts of foreign fighters (and John McCain) entering the country at will.  &#10;&#10;A recent Middle East Eye report outlined that the "Syrian economy has effectively ceased to function, and President Bashar al-Assad's government is almost entirely dependent on loans from Iran and some aid from the Russian Federation".  &#10;&#10;Towards the end of last year the desperate position saw Damascus even issue a new "Martyrs Stamp Duty", whose proceeds will go to the families of fallen soldiers and other militia members.  &#10;&#10;Aleppo, the country's largest city and once commercial hub, is being pummelled by a regular supply of barrel bombs with the hospitals being forced underground and ISIL forces closing in.  &#10;&#10;Assad himself is seen less and less. On a New Year's Eve trip to what was said to be "the frontlines" in his own capital, the president's smiles and patriotic music couldn't disguise the occasional crack of background gunfire.  &#10;&#10;Several days later the Assad publicity blitz continued with a very public appearance at a prayer in a mosque in Damascus.  &#10;&#10;The New York Times were so surprised to see him that they pointed out he'd shaved his moustache, although others claimed it has simply gone white, perhaps due the stress of the continued conflict.  &#10;&#10;Yet, the focus on Assad the individual, rather than Syria the country, and the narrative of government against the opposition, doesn't explain the hollowing out of the former and the fragmentation of the latter.  &#10;&#10;This time last year the Geneva II Peace Conference marked the high water mark of the Syrian opposition as a coherent and seemingly viable actor. Since then, the corrosiveness of ISIL's rapid spread and the increased brutality of the conflict has seemingly made an immoderate crisis an impossible place for moderate actors such as the FSA and the National Syrian Coalition.  &#10;&#10;Khaled Khoja was elected the new leader of the coalition at the start of the year and quickly signalled his unwillingness for them to attend another attempt at peace talks, this time organised by Russia.  &#10;&#10;What Syria is and what it could eventually become will have regional and global ramifications that are hard to predict. Among the most unlikely scenarios is the return of a unitary state with full control of territory within its borders under the effective sovereignty of Assad.  	The influence of the nominal head of state is disappearing along with his&#10;country.&#10;&#10;

Miss Maddie’s house was one fire.  &#10;&#10;“That’s the day that God convicted me in my heart that I wanted to be a firefighter when I grew up,” Cochran said. “All I thought about growing up in Shreveport was not being poor and being a firefighter.”  &#10;&#10;And God granted Kelvin Cochran the desires of his heart. The little boy in the shotgun shack grew up to become the fire chief of Shreveport. He was named the Atlanta fire chief in 2008 – a position he served until 2009 when was called to serve in the Obama Administration as a fire administrator. In 2010 he returned to Atlanta where he was unanimously confirmed to once again be the city’s fire chief.  &#10;&#10;But now Chief Cochran’s storied career is up in smoke – all because of a book he wrote for a men’s Bible study group at his Baptist church.  &#10;&#10;CLICK HERE TO FOLLOW TODD ON FACEBOOK FOR CONSERVATIVE CONVERSATION!  &#10;&#10;Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed announced Tuesday that Cochran had been fired. The announcement came on the same day Cochran was supposed to return to work following a 30-day suspension.  &#10;&#10;“The LGBT members of our community have a right to be able to express their views and convictions about sexuality and deserve to be respected for their position without hate or discrimination,” Cochran told me in an exclusive interview. “But Christians also have a right to express our belief regarding our faith and be respected for our position without hate and without discrimination. In the United States, no one should be vilified, hated or discriminated against for expressing their beliefs.”  &#10;&#10;Cochran had been suspended in November because of a passage he wrote about homosexuality in a book titled, “Who Told You That You Were Naked?” The book’s theme is about biblical morality.  &#10;&#10;“This is about judgment,” Mayor Reed said during a Tuesday press conference. “This is not about religious freedom. This is not about free speech. Judgment is the basis of the problem.”  &#10;&#10;Last November the mayor posted a public condemnation of the fire chief on his official Facebook page.  &#10;&#10;“I profoundly disagree with and am deeply disturbed by the sentiments expressed in the paperback regarding the LGBT community,” the mayor wrote. “I will not tolerate discrimination of any kind within my administration.”  &#10;&#10;The mayor went on to inform the public that Cochran had been suspended without pay and was ordered to complete a sensitivity training class.  &#10;&#10;“I want to be clear that the material in Chief Cochran’s book is not representative of my personal beliefs, and is inconsistent with the Administration’s work to make Atlanta a more welcoming city for all of her citizens -- regardless of their sexual orientation, gender, race and religious beliefs,” Mayor Reed wrote.  &#10;&#10;So what in the world did Cochran write that was so offensive to the mayor and the LGBT community?  &#10;&#10;According to the GA Voice, a publication that covers the LGBT community, there were two items that caused concern:  &#10;&#10;“Uncleanness – whatever is opposite of purity; including sodomy, homosexuality, lesbianism, pederasty, bestiality, all other forms of sexual perversion.”  &#10;&#10;“Naked men refuse to give in, so they pursue sexual fulfillment through multiple partners, with the opposite sex, the same sex, and sex outside of marriage and many other vile, vulgar and inappropriate ways which defile their body – temple and dishonor God.”  &#10;&#10;Cochran said he referenced homosexuality on less than a half a page in the 160-page book.  &#10;&#10;“I did not single out homosexuality,” he said. ‘I simply spoke to sex being created by God for pro-creation and He intended it to be between a man and a woman in holy matrimony – and that any other sex outside of that is sin.”  &#10;&#10;Cochran told me that someone within the department obtained a copy of the book and took it to openly-gay city council member Alex Wan.  &#10;&#10;Wan released a statement supporting Cochran’s termination and said it “sends a strong message to employees about how much we value diversity and how we adhere to a non-discriminatory environment.”  &#10;&#10;The book caused a firestorm within Atlanta’s LGBT community and there were many calls for him to be fired – a decision the mayor finally agreed to.  &#10;&#10;“I guess they got what they asked for,” Cochran said.  &#10;&#10;Georgia Equality Executive Director Jeff Graham told GA Voice Cochran’s “anti- gay” views could result in a hostile work environment.  &#10;&#10;“This is not about his religious views but his about his ability to lead a diverse work force,” he said. “It’s unfortunate that this had to happen. I feel the mayor has done the right thing to ensure all employees are treated fairly.”  &#10;&#10;The allegations against Cochran amount to a he-said, he-said between the fire chief and the mayor.  &#10;&#10;Reed said that he had no knowledge that Cochran was writing a book. However, Cochran said the director of Atlanta’s ethics office had not only given him permission to write the book, but to also mention in his biography that he was the city’s fire chief.  &#10;&#10;Cochran said he gave a copy of the book to Mayor Reed in January, 2014 and the mayor told him he planned on reading it during an upcoming trip.  &#10;&#10;Cochran also admitted that he gave copies of the book to several members of the fire department – individuals with whom he had personal relationships.  &#10;&#10;The mayor also took issue with Cochran speaking publicly about his suspension. However, Cochran said he honored the mayor’s guidance and did not speak to the media. He did, however, share his testimony in several churches.  &#10;&#10;“I did not dishonor him in the process,” Cochran told me.  &#10;&#10;Cochran wants to make clear that he does not hate anyone.  &#10;&#10;“The essence of the Christian faith is a love without condition, sir,” he told me. “I have demonstrated that love in the fire service for 34 years. There’s not any person of any people group that has interacted with me for any measure of time that can say I have hate or disregard or discrimination in my heart for any people group.”  &#10;&#10;Cochran’s plight has drawn condemnation from a number of religious groups across Georgia including the influential Georgia Baptist Convention.  &#10;&#10;“This is appalling,” said Robert White, president of the Georgia Baptist Convention. “This has everything to do with his religious beliefs.”  &#10;&#10;White told me he believes the mayor succumbed to pressure from the city’s LGBT community.  &#10;&#10;“It’s a frightening day in the United States when a person cannot express their faith without fears of persecution following,” he told me. “It’s persecution when a godly fire chief loses his job over expressing his Christian faith.”  &#10;&#10;And the fire chief’s firing could spark public protests and demonstrations from the state’s Christian community.  &#10;&#10;“We’re past the point of taking a public stand,” White told me. “Christians must stand up for their rights.”  &#10;&#10;Cochran told me he is considering his legal options – but one thing is certain. He has no desire to get his old job back.  &#10;&#10;“I believe God has greater things for me,” the father and grandfather said. “I love the fire services. It’s a childhood dream come true.”  &#10;&#10;And don’t go feeling sorry for Chief Cochran.  &#10;&#10;“I’m not discouraged and I’m not downtrodden,” he said. “This is a God thing and He’s going to do great things and He will vindicate me publicly.”  	Former Atlanta Fire Chief Kelvin Cochran’s storied career is up in smoke – all&#10;because of a book he wrote for a men’s Bible study group at his Baptist&#10;church.&#10;&#10;
022-badsciencedosdontslovedatingfi	guardian	2015-01-12T17:14:19Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/12/bad-science-dos-donts-love-dating-five-tips	Naomi McAuliffe	Forget the bad science. Here are my top 5 dos and don’ts of dating	You would be forgiven for thinking that centuries of human society would mean that we were now at a stage where we didn’t need help finding another human being whom we could bear to be around and who wanted to get naked with us. But you would be mistaken. It seems as time progresses we need more and more tactics for tricking someone into a relationship. Some people need pickup artists to help them manipulate women, others think “science” will provide the 21st-century love potion.  &#10;&#10;In the latest use of scientists’ time, they have found that eating dessert on a date increases the likelihood that there’ll be a second date. This research is flawed on a number of levels, not least because you shouldn’t have a meal on a first date: too many food-related potential disasters and not enough alcohol. Plus, if you’re on a date with a diabetic, you could be responsible for putting them into a coma, which is likely to hamper the relationship.  &#10;&#10;Instead, here are some further helpful dos and don’ts when it comes to dating:  &#10;&#10;1) Don’t call it dating. It’s a horrible word and a horrible concept. Instead, think of it as going for a drink or to a gallery or whatever, and there being someone else there. This relieves the pressure to be attractive and the crushing disappointment that comes with it.  &#10;&#10;2) Do get drunk. There is no downside to this. OK, there are a couple of downsides. The trick is to get drunk enough to be hilariously funny, intelligent and confident but not so drunk that you lower your standards and impair your ability to get the hell out of there if it becomes boring or creepy. Even if you get so drunk that you dance on a table, start crying or vomit into your lap, you can always blame the booze. If you don’t drink, then I’m afraid there is nothing I can do for you: best of luck.  &#10;&#10;3) Don’t be too self-deprecating. It is a good idea to show that you don’t take yourself too seriously and it can be endearing, but keep it to the stories about giving a presentation with your skirt/shirt tucked into your knickers/Y-fronts or when you had a conversation about nobody taking you seriously while you had mustard on your face. Save the stories about when you soiled yourself until at least the fourth date. You don’t want to waste these comedy gold stories on someone you might only see a couple of times. When it comes to defecating stories, you don’t want to unload your A-list stories on someone who might not be worthy. This is a journey of discovery, so temporarily hold some mystery back.  &#10;&#10;4) Do find out their politics. Life is too short to waste on someone who thinks Hitler had a point. It is good to surround yourself with people with different views to your own because arguments are fun, but everyone has their red-line issues and you might as well shake them down on these before you spend too much on booze. So try to turn the conversation round to Ched Evans, free speech or the order of greatness of the Star Wars films (which for reference is: episode V, episode IV, Episode VI, episodes I-III don’t exist and should never be mentioned). If you feel they’re wildly wrong on any of these subjects, shriek that you’ve left the oven on and run.  &#10;&#10;5) Don’t talk about your ex(es) all night. You may like to use every opportunity to talk about the profound personality flaws of your former lovers, but it’s rather ungallant and makes you look slightly like a psychopath. You want to hint at the fact that you have been in a relationship before, as it implies that there are human beings who don’t find your regular presence completely loathsome. But make sure you don’t get a nervous tick when you talk about it or start stabbing the table – these are what are known as “giveaways”.  &#10;&#10;In general, we have to be a little wary of claims that science holds the key to love, as many myths abound. For instance, pheromones don’t work in humans. Dopamine is released when you’re in love and when you eat chocolate, but also when you take cocaine and smoke fags, and the latter two may very well hamper your success at relationships. Other research shows that you increase your chances of falling in love if you ask just 36 questions and then stare into their eyes for four minutes. Which looks a lot like just showing an interest in someone and finding out you have things in common, so not exactly rocket science.  	Naomi McAuliffe: Obviously we don’t call it dating because it’s a horrible concept. Outside of avoiding pseudo-science, that’s one of my top tips
023-beatingyourpartnercrimenotilln	guardian	2015-01-12T13:05:33Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/12/beating-your-partner-crime-not-illness-domestic-violence	Julie Bindel	Beating your partner is a crime, not an illness	What stops a man from beating up and raping his female partner? According to research published today, it is not sanctions imposed by the criminal justice system, such as prison or probation, but attending a course with other abusers.  &#10;&#10;“Domestic violence perpetrator programmes (DVPPs): steps towards change”, by the feminist academics Liz Kelly and Nicole Westmarland, is based on interviews with men who attend programmes that aim to re-educate them about their behaviour to improve the safety of women and children.  &#10;&#10;The research – which also draws on the experiences of partners of the violent men, a small number of children and the staff of these programmes – finds that “the vast majority of men who abuse their partners stop their physical and sexual violence if they attend a DVPP” and that such programmes “could play an important role in the quest to end domestic violence”.  &#10;&#10;Some of the figures look impressive. For example, before attending the programme a third of men asked women to perform sexual acts against their wishes, but none did so after taking part. Cases of the men using a weapon against their partner reduced from 29% to nil.  &#10;&#10;But there are other findings that give me cause for concern. Ninety per cent of the men interviewed had, prior to the course, made excuses about and attempted to justify their abusive behaviour. After the course, this tendency had barely reduced at all, with almost three-quarters of the men still making excuses. Over the years, when making plain my scepticism about DVPPs I have been told that the aim of such courses is to make perpetrators accountable and get them to face up to what they have done. This finding shows that this is one of the weakest outcomes.  &#10;&#10;What about prevention of domestic violence? Does the existence of these courses deter others from using their fists to settle an argument? On average, two women in England and Wales die each week as a result of domestic violence, a figure that has remained constant for decades. I can’t imagine a government- led information campaign with the slogan, “Violent men beware! Beat up your wife and go on a course”.  &#10;&#10;Over half of the women reported feeling “very safe” after the programme, compared with less than one in 10 before it. But that leaves almost half of the women still in fear. One major tactic used by violent men is to control the household finances so that the woman is totally reliant on him and has no means of escape. The research found that after DVPP, this behaviour changed “only marginally”.  &#10;&#10;There is also some evidence that DVPPs do not necessarily encourage women to leave violent men. The researchers used a control group of women who were accessing support for domestic violence but whose partner was not attending a DVPP in order to compare results. The control group also reported a significant reduction in violence from the men, but were more likely to end the relationship with the abuser than the women whose partners were attending a DVPP. Perhaps such programmes act as marriage guidance counselling and help keep couples together? Is this not dangerous?  &#10;&#10;The impression given by the widespread acceptability of these programmes is that those who beat and rape their partners are in need of support and help, not punishment. There are moves by the Home Office to roll out restorative justice measures in cases of sexual and domestic violence, and a recent government inquiry into stalking legislation posed the question of whether “treatment programmes should be available for perpetrators and, if so, what should be their content?”  &#10;&#10;According to Nicole Westmarland, one of the report authors, “we have hardly any knowledge about how things like probation, fines, or even prison affect men’s attitudes and behaviours towards women”.  &#10;&#10;This is true, but mainly because so few perpetrators are held to account by the courts. We appear to have given up the battle to have domestic violence treated as a crime like any other – which used to be the feminist mantra – and have now declared the criminal justice system unfit for purpose in dealing with violence in the home.  &#10;&#10;We should not be giving up on the justice system before its potential effectiveness has been truly tested. There are many ways its approach to domestic violence could be improved. Pilot programmes should be rolled out nationwide, directing police to mandatorily arrest those who have committed acts of violence towards partners or ex-partners. This way, perpetrators will realise that it is not the decision of their victims to send them to court, so victims will be in no further danger of revenge for doing so.  &#10;&#10;The Crown Prosecution Service needs to take a more robust approach in getting perpetrators to court and speed up the process so the victim does not have to wait months for an outcome. During this process, the victims involved should be protected and supported by state-funded initiatives.  &#10;&#10;Public education campaigns that aim to tug on the heartstrings of abusers, such as posters depicting women crying and sporting injuries, should be swapped for images of men in handcuffs or in a prison cell.  &#10;&#10;Young women and men need to be educated about what is at the root of domestic and sexual violence – that it is a cause and consequence of inequality and sexism. People who beat their partners are making a choice. We need to make sure the message that this is a serious crime, not an illness, is disseminated in schools.  &#10;&#10;Let us return to the notion, once at the heart of the feminist challenge to domestic violence, that beating up your partner should carry as serious a consequence as assaulting a member of the public in the street.

024-bedblockingsocialcarepolicypro	guardian	2015-01-09T17:30:01Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/09/bedblocking-social-care-policy-profits-ahead-of-people	Deborah Orr	‘Bedblocking’ – the result of social care policy that puts profits ahead of people	Bedblocking. What a phrase. People having to stay in hospital, even though they are well enough to be discharged, because there’s no social care in place for them. David Cameron says it’s “a demand problem”. But it’s not, of course. It’s a supply problem. It’s hard to make money from social care. So it’s not massively amenable to privatisation.  &#10;&#10;I suppose this was one of the areas where, Cameron fondly imagined, the Big Society would step in. As ever, instead, starving one part of the public sector of cash simply left another part struggling to cope with the consequences.  &#10;&#10;Back in 2010, when Gordon Brown suggested implementing a 10% levy on inherited wealth to fund social care for older people, the Conservatives had this to say: “RIP off. Now Gordon wants £20,000 when you die. Don’t vote for Labour’s new death tax.”  &#10;&#10;Instead, social care for older people has had its funding cut, so there’s simply not enough money to go round. The demand problem that Cameron now speaks of is one that was entirely predictable and, indeed, entirely predicted. Policymakers have been fretting over the future challenges posed by our ageing population for decades. Now this time has arrived, and there’s nothing there in the way of provision for it.  &#10;&#10;Care for elderly people is one of those things that’s not hard to sort out, given money, and almost impossible to sort out without it. It’s one of those things that, in theory, offers choice – staying at home with support, moving into sheltered accommodation, going into residential care. In reality, however, people are so terrified of the prospect of being in a position where they have to make such choices that they’d rather not think about it at all. One knows vaguely that there aren’t many decent alternatives, so staying at home becomes the one thing that is comforting. Being close to the past matters when the present and the future feel like a horrible staging-post before death.  &#10;&#10;It doesn’t help that there’s so much sentimentality around the issue. Myleene Klass appeared to believe she was being socially aware by banging on about how awful the idea of a mansion tax is, because it would hurt little old ladies living in big houses that had been their homes for decades.  &#10;&#10;But, actually, Klass was describing something that isn’t necessarily that desirable: an elderly person living in a home she can no longer heat, clean or look after, the neighbours she once knew long gone, clinging to the past instead of living in and enjoying the present.  &#10;&#10;One of the great paradoxes of old age is that, at a time in life when change is very dynamic and has to be managed a lot, people are persuaded that trying to stop time, instead of moving forward and adapting to circumstances, is the right thing to do. Care at home is pushed as the thing to aspire to, in part because – even though it’s expensive, difficult to organise and not very satisfactory in outcome – it has the attractive advantage of needing no capital investment.  &#10;&#10;Over Christmas, I watched the film Quartet, which is set in a retirement home for musicians. One was supposed to feel a bit sorry for its inhabitants, who had known success and adulation when they were young, and who missed those days. All they had to do to raise the funds to keep the home going was put on a concert featuring the legends that were themselves.  &#10;&#10;Having looked at a couple of local care homes when my mother was ill a couple of years back, I can only say that the twilight years of those characters were indeed a fiction. Sure, nice retirement homes exist – if you can afford them. But the limitations of so many of them mean that the whole concept is sullied. Rather than being places where new phases of life are undertaken, they have become places you end up in when all hope of enjoying life is gone.  &#10;&#10;It’s interesting that inheritance has become so much an aspect of debate around care for elderly people. This, too, is a tacit signal that you are too old to spend your own money on yourself. At some point, the duty is to hang on to your assets, so that they can be passed on to your family – and without nasty government death taxes. It would be nice if people weren’t encouraged to believe that it was selfish to invest in their own lives just because they are no longer young.  &#10;&#10;Elderly people are blocking beds not just because they can no longer look after themselves at home, but also because our society is not encouraged to think of elderly lives as valuable and deserving of joy and fun, vitality and change. Lack of pay is one reason why people aren’t queing up to work with older people. But another is that it’s not seen as enjoyable, because older people are viewed as a bundle of sad, expensive, social-policy problems, rather than people with lives worth living to the full.  	Deborah Orr: The growing NHS crisis is exacerbated by an approach to healthcare that views elderly people as sad, expensive problems

But there are real, easily achieved ways to positively impact your life beginning January 1.I’ve assembled a cheat sheet of 15. They aren’t in any particular order, so you can pick any one to start with.  &#10;&#10;If you complete just five, you’ll notice a demonstrable improvement in your existence. But if you get through all 15, you could remake your life.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;1\. Try to recall one dream you had as a kid — whether it was being a poet or a rock drummer or a multimillionaire stock trader — and take just a single step in that direction. So often, the ideas we had as children were good ones, and we abandoned them out of fear. The step in the direction of your childhood dream can be very modest — signing up for a symposium on poetry, scheduling a single drum lesson, buying a DVD on stock trading. Frozen dreams have a way of thawing out rapidly when you warm them just a tiny bit.  &#10;&#10;2\. Think of your life story, going all the way back to infancy, as an autobiographical book that you can hold in your hands. Now, imagine which page or paragraph you are tempted to tear out and remove from the story. That page or paragraph might be the one that makes you feel profoundly sad or powerless or guilty or ashamed. Next, share it with someone who knows you well but has never heard about that event or phase in your life. Being willing to disclose the events in life we want to turn a blind eye to takes away the power those events have over us.  &#10;&#10;3\. Give a meaningful gift to a friend of yours on a random day — not his birthday or her anniversary or Christmas. Giving gifts on those days is fine, but that isn’t the same as an unexpected, unscheduled gift. Those are the ones that feel riskier to give and have more power to bond you to others who receive them. And that’s because they’re real and independent expressions of friendship, affection, admiration or love.  &#10;&#10;4\. Send handwritten notes to three people you admire most in the world, no matter how powerful or famous, tell them sincerely exactly why you admire them and ask to meet for 10 minutes. There’s a real chance one of them will take you up on the offer. And that one meeting could change you, because great energy is contagious and being in the company of it can stay with you.  &#10;&#10;5\. Give some amount (no matter how small) to the charity you care most about. Giving is a miracle, because it helps others while also telling your unconscious mind that yours is a life of abundance, not scarcity. And that invites more treasures into your existence.  &#10;&#10;6\. Stop telling yourself you love people just because you grew up with them. This is a big one, but a really important one. Did your parents and siblings earn your love by unconditionally loving you as a child? If so, great. But if you’ve been wishing that had been the case and have felt unwilling to let the dream of having had unconditionally loving parents or siblings slip away, then loosen your grip. If the people you grew up with weren’t focused on helping you stay true to yourself, then admit it to yourself. You might stop unconsciously recruiting people just like them into your life.  &#10;&#10;7\. Schedule an initial psychotherapy session. Psychotherapy is the gold standard way to begin to get to know yourself more deeply. In a world of distractions and depersonalization, it remains the technique most reliably focused on restoring your connection to your true self. Hopefully, that first session will convince you of the power of psychotherapy to change your life, and you’ll schedule more. No one with the financial ability to be in psychotherapy should deny himself or herself that transformational opportunity.  &#10;&#10;8\. Get angry about something unfair, say so out loud and don’t stand for it. Anger gets a really bad rap in our culture; it’s accused of everything from destroying people spiritually to causing heart attacks. But suppressed anger can be more toxic. When you’re offended by something you hear about in the news or you see unfolding in your personal life, try saying so, in no uncertain terms, when you’re asked about it — or maybe even if you aren’t. For those of you who have been living lives of quiet frustration, letting yourselves be very direct and very mad about something that sincerely outrages you can start to crack the shell that has your most powerful self inside it.  &#10;&#10;9\. Take two minutes to think about life as a labyrinth. Mazes are built to frustrate people and get them lost. They’re full of dead ends designed to make people give up and call for helicopters to pluck them out. Not so with labyrinths. Labyrinths may wind this way and that way. They may take you far from where you thought you were heading. But they always, always lead to the center. And that’s what life is like. Keep walking, keep your faith and life will take you where you are supposed to go. The turn toward the center could be just a few steps away, when you least expect it.  &#10;&#10;10\. Try praying, at least once. If you haven’t prayed ever or haven’t prayed lately, you’ll discover that the act of praying for what you care deeply about has the effect of reminding you what that thing or those things really are. It also has the effect of reminding you that there is a great power in the universe that you are a part of. There’s something interesting about praying; even people who say they don’t believe in God are loathe to pray for the opposite of what they really want. How come? Is it because that, underneath all that cynicism, they actually do believe?  &#10;&#10;11\. Read "Franny and Zooey" by J.D. Salinger, "The War of Art" by Steven Pressfield or "Blue Dog" by George Rodrigue (or, even better, all three). These slim volumes have the power to transform people, and I keep handing them out to patients and friends (along with — please forgive the narcissism — my book, "Living the Truth").  &#10;&#10;12\. Buy one piece of art. It doesn’t need to be expensive. It just needs to appeal to you. Why? Because art is the antidote to our sometimes sterile, technologically driven culture. It makes humanity go viral in a way that YouTube can’t. It also confirms your connection to things that can’t be measured — like your personal vision of beauty.  &#10;&#10;13\. Watch the movie "Miracle," with Kurt Russell. This film about the 1980 U.S. Olympic men’s hockey team defeating Russia’s team is so good, it can convince you to take on the next great challenge in your life. I don’t know anyone who has watched it and been unaffected by it.  &#10;&#10;14\. Tell your romantic partner one thing you would find exciting that you have not yet told that person. In my experience as a therapist, I’ve found that people can remain strangers to one another, in terms of passion, even after 10 or 20 years of marriage. We keep sexual secrets. Let one out. See what happens. Take the risk.  &#10;&#10;15\. Stand up for someone else. You’ll have the opportunity in 2015. I promise. Maybe in your home. Maybe in your neighborhood. Maybe at work. Defending someone will reassure that person and empower you.  &#10;&#10;So, there are your 15 keys to making 2015 a transformational year.  &#10;&#10;Don’t delay. Start on the list January 1, and by this time next year, God willing, you’ll be ready for the 16 steps for 2016. Like is life that: a never-ending process of self-improvement.  &#10;&#10;Dr. Keith Ablow is a psychiatrist and member of the Fox News Medical A-Team.

There is nowhere near enough gayness on screen	Comedian, actor and – apparently – bewildered Victorian time-traveller Billy Crystal disappointed millions of fans and general conscience-havers this week when, in an interview with the Television Critics Association, he said that he thinks gay characters on TV are “pushing it a little too far”.  &#10;&#10;“I hope people don’t abuse it and shove it in our face,” Crystal continued, referring to gay sex scenes, “to the point where it feels like an everyday kind of thing.” He later attempted a half-hearted backpedal, telling the Hollywood Reporter that, don’t worry, he totally thinks straight people are gross, too: “What I meant was that whenever sex or graphic nudity of any kind (gay or straight) is gratuitous to the plot or story, it becomes a little too much for my taste.”  &#10;&#10;Sporting try, Billy, but we can see your tell: several of your chosen turns of phrase have been used to dehumanise and deny representation to gay people for decades – “shove it in our face”, in particular, is tantamount to a coded gay slur. For that matter, it is not even possible to “shove” heterosexual sexuality in anyone’s face, because there is no human on earth whose face isn’t already completely submerged in and saturated by it. Gratuitous straight sex is a defining plot device in pretty much all media: primetime soaps, daytime talk shows, beer commercials, Billy Crystal movies.  &#10;&#10;We know what you meant.  &#10;&#10;Of course, it’s perfectly fine to be uncomfortable with overt displays of sexuality, regardless of orientation – everyone has the right to set and defend their own sexual boundaries. I, for instance, find the idea of a woman loudly faking an orgasm in a crowded delicatessen so unbearably awkward that it makes me want to crawl out of my skin and flush the rest of me down the toilet. And that’s why I FAST-FORWARD THROUGH THAT PART OR WATCH SOMETHING ELSE.  &#10;&#10;It’s almost as though you can choose what media you want to consume without policing anyone’s sexual expression and furthering the oppression of an already marginalised and underrepresented group.  &#10;&#10;But Crystal’s dull, antique disdain for gay sex actually manages to crystallise a very important, progressive point: not only is there not “too much” gayness in media, gayness doesn’t go anywhere near far enough. Back up the gay truck and just flood the place. It’s about time.  &#10;&#10;If you want evidence that our media is broken (or, more unsettlingly, working just as it’s intended), look no further than the staggering whiteness, straightness, and maleness of the 2015 Oscar nominations. As Bidisha summed up in this paper last week: “Every nominated best director, screenwriter, screenplay adapter and original score composer is a white man. All the nominated best actors and best supporting actors are white men. All but one of the best picture nominations are about how hard it is being an entitled, genius white man. All the nominated best foreign language film directors are men. All but one of the documentary directors – Laura Poitras for Citizenfour – is a man. In the best picture category, seven films are directed by white men and the eighth, Selma, is directed by a black woman, Ava DuVernay, who was snubbed for best director.”  &#10;&#10;When it comes to diversity in media – after hundreds of years of straight white guys telling straight white guy stories, deciding which subject matters are serious (straight white guy stuff) and which are frivolous (everything else), and congratulating themselves on being the best at fulfilling their own rigged, narcissistic standards – I’m not interested in parity. I want overcompensation. I want new stories.  &#10;&#10;And I don’t just mean that from a social justice standpoint. I’m bored. A time is going to come – in my lifetime, I hope – when just being an angsty white man won’t be enough any more. It won’t carry a movie. It won’t justify an Oscar.  &#10;&#10;That’s not to say that straight white guy stories can’t be compelling, heartbreaking and important – simply that we’ve heard them already. We’ve heard them at the expense of millions of other stories that never get funding, that are rewritten and whitewashed, that are needlessly recentered around a white person a la Orange is the New Black.  &#10;&#10;When these conversations come up, some genius inevitably pipes up with what they think is a trump card – some version of: “Oh, so we should have a show where every character is a disabled black Muslim lesbian!?!?!?” As though nothing could be more absurd and unthinkable. As though there aren’t innumerable TV shows and movies with all-white ensemble casts that go uncritiqued. And, to answer your question, UM, YES. That show sounds incredible and I would watch the crap out of it. It’s only an absurd concept if you believe that disabled black Muslim lesbians are somehow less valid, less valuable, than straight white men. They’re not. There is no such thing as a niche human.  &#10;&#10;Representation is humanisation, and we have an inexpressible amount of ground to make up if we want to begin to establish gay people and trans people and disabled people and people of colour and fat people and sex workers as fully realised human beings – not tropes, morality tales, or comic relief – in the public consciousness. I’d say we could stand a few decades of overrepresentation, in fact. Come on, Hollywood. Shove it in my face.  	Lindy West: Crystal might not want gay sex ‘shoved in his face’. But after hundreds of years of straight white guys telling straight white guy stories, I say bring on the disabled black lesbians 
027-bokoharamterrornigeriagovernme	guardian	2015-01-12T17:00:10Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/12/boko-haram-terror-nigeria-government-elections	Elizabeth Donnelly	Boko Haram’s deadly advance must be stopped, but how?	Last week’s massacre of perhaps 2,000 people in and around the Nigerian town of Baga, and the bombings of markets in the north-east using children perhaps as young as 10, mark not a new tactic for the violent extremist organisation Boko Haram, but an intensification of its existing behaviour.  &#10;&#10;Boko Haram is pushing the boundaries of the extreme and is challenging – and seemingly succeeding – in overstretching Nigeria’s 7th Infantry Division, tasked to fight the insurgents in the north-east. In recent months it has made significant territorial gains and is in control of many towns around the Borno state capital, Maiduguri, though this is in a constant state of flux as the military defends state capitals and recaptures lost urban centres.  &#10;&#10;Speculation as to the aims of Jama’atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda’awati wal-Jihad, the real name of the network of Islamist, cultist and criminal elements that grew from a radical but initially largely non-violent movement, continues. And the logical conclusion is that it is capturing territory to carve out an Islamic caliphate in north-eastern Nigeria. But the group is decimating what is in its path. And it is greedy: the longer Boko Haram goes unimpeded and the more confident it becomes, the more it seems to want.  &#10;&#10;So perhaps what is its endgame is the wrong question. Boko Haram is fighting because it can, because it is a lethal fighting force and has children and conscripts to send into the field as terrified, intoxicated and indoctrinated weapons and shields.  &#10;&#10;The question that needs to be answered is how did this terrorist threat grow to such horrifying proportions, killing thousands and displacing millions – a threat unimaginable in a democratic Nigeria 10 years ago? And what can be done to stop it?  &#10;&#10;Nigeria’s military is around 130,000-strong, and has been previously lauded for its peacekeeping successes in civil conflicts in Africa, but now, with a worsening conflict at home, questions are being asked about just how hollowed out such an important institution has become. There are varying reports as to why the 8,500 troops deployed to battle Boko Haram have been unable to halt its advance.  &#10;&#10;Allegations of corruption; misallocated resources; poorly trained, poorly equipped and poorly directed troops; fear; low morale; and deficient interagency cooperation all have a basis. While promises have been made to investigate reported abuses by the Nigerian armed forces against civilians, in December 2014 an army court sentenced 54 soldiers to death for mutiny and cowardice – for refusing to fight Boko Haram.  &#10;&#10;In the short term, preventing Boko Haram from expanding further relies on a more effective military response with a much-bolstered force. But this is impossible without essential leadership from the centre, without tough calls and effective management.  &#10;&#10;The international community will come under increasing criticism for not doing enough to stem the tide of Boko Haram’s terror. Assistance has been offered by a range of partners including the US, UK, France, Russia and China – some of it has been declined – but it is likely more offers of assistance will come. Nigeria believes its neighbours Chad, Cameroon and Niger could be doing more.  &#10;&#10;But domestic and international confidence in the will or capacity – or both – of Nigeria’s federal government to take the decisions to mount an effective response is fast waning in the face of increasing casualties. Nigerians will go to the polls on 14 February to vote for a new president and national assembly.  &#10;&#10;How much this violence, predominantly in three of Nigeria’s 36 states, will affect the outcome is unclear because Nigerians face a range of daily challenges. There are concerns, however, that the majority of people in the states at the epicentre of the conflict – thought to be potential opposition supporters – will be disenfranchised, along with over a million internally displaced people. However politicised the crisis may become in the runup to elections, the insurgency will outlast the event.  	Elizabeth Donnelly: Confidence in Nigeria’s government to contain Boko Haram is waning, and the upcoming elections are unlikely to provide a silver bullet
028-britaineconomicrecoverylocalen	guardian	2015-01-06T06:00:04Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/06/britain-economic-recovery-local-enterprises-building-bloqs	Aditya Chakrabortty	The big orange shed that holds the key to Britain’s economic recovery	On an industrial estate on the northernmost outskirts of the capital hulks a big orange shed that will form part of the answer as to whether Britain really can fix its broken economic model. A big claim, I know – but practically everyone who visits Building Bloqs comes away convinced of its importance.  &#10;&#10;Perhaps it’s the promise it holds: bringing jobs to a jobless local economy, re-inserting manufacturing into a deindustrialised husk of a place. Maybe it’s the warmth of the directors, all in their 30s: Al Parra, ever ready with schooners of tea; Arnaud Nichols, always enthusing about some engineering project; and Alex Motta, whose cheap gourmet canteen feeds mezze to the local forklift drivers. These guys aren’t even in it for the money. Like the Co-op grocers or the Big Issue, Building Bloqs is a social enterprise: it has to pay its way in the world, but seeks to reinvest the profits and caps how much anyone can take out.  &#10;&#10;No wonder local councillors vow to do all they can to help Al, Arnaud and Alex, or that George Osborne invites them to Downing Street. Or that they not only win an award for innovation, but one of the judges now does their books for free. Yet despite all the goodwill and the unanimous political agreement that this is the kind of start-up Britain needs, it’s touch and go if Building Bloqs will survive. Just why that should be is a compelling, depressing and instructive tale about how little politicians on all sides have learned in the wake of the crash.  &#10;&#10;To grasp the importance of Building Bloqs, just look at the even bigger neighbouring sheds in whose shadow it sits. Yes, that’s the giant Tesco where on Black Friday last November punters fought for marked-down coffee machines. And it’s right next to the Ikea whose opening sparked a near-riot. Both those retailing behemoths are on Glover Drive, named after Glover and Main, which manufactured millions of the gas stoves used in British kitchens after the war. This entire area, where Tottenham tips into Edmonton, used to be a manufacturing powerhouse. Now it’s all gone, and what’s replaced the factories is … sweet FA.  &#10;&#10;I grew up here, and have seen this area slide within three decades from a place of working-class prosperity to one of the most deprived parts of the country. Nowadays they call it Shanktown: a place of knife murders and gang violence.  &#10;&#10;Against that backdrop of dead-end criminality and plastic consumerism, Building Bloqs stands out. This isn’t some Pathé newsreel factory. The people inside aren’t on an assembly line churning out the same goods. Instead, they’re freelancers who pay about £20 a day to hire a bench and get access to all the tools and knowhow of Al and Arnaud – and each other. It’s called a makerspace, a non-profit collaborative workplace of a kind spreading across America, yet still quite new in Britain.  &#10;&#10;In the 14 months since opening, Building Bloqs has transformed lives. Set designer Hugo, who couldn’t afford his own workspace and used to work either in a garden or in the theatre, now has a cheap space to build, experiment and store his designs. Joe, who for years had to rely on more established mates to pass him carpentry jobs, now has an HQ, a client base and an enterprise. Of the 70 members, around 40% are running a self-sustaining business out of this building. Around 30 livelihoods and households have been changed by it, two enterprises have been spun out – and a hollowed-out local economy has received a substantial boost.  &#10;&#10;This is the march of the makers promised by Osborne. This is the rebalancing all the politicians prayed for. But this is also the place that shows how all that talk was just guff. Because it is an open question whether Building Bloqs lives or dies.  &#10;&#10;Despite pulling 60-hour weeks, the directors draw no salary from it. They eat and do their laundry at the shed, and work on the side for cash. Last weekend, Arnaud totted up his entire life savings: he has £200 to his name. Although the company has been breaking even for the past few months, the roof leaks, half the electricity runs off extension leads, and the unheated open space is Arctic.  &#10;&#10;Why are they in such a state? For exactly the same reason everyone likes them: because they’re new and different. So different that, although Al has tried everywhere for lending from nationalised Lloyds to ethical Triodos, he couldn’t even raise a £10,000 overdraft. Had he wanted financing to open a franchise of McDonald’s he would have had fewer hurdles to jump, and Edmonton would have a few more zero-hours jobs, and be a few thousand quarter pounders further into an obesity epidemic. But a new social enterprise with no financial track record proved too much for the bank managers to get their heads around.  &#10;&#10;Politically, the response has been just as woeful. The rightwing solution to Building Bloqs’ problems was on offer at that Downing Street social hosted by Osborne, where “sharing economy” start-ups rubbed shoulders with venture capitalists. Yet when Arnaud buttonholed an investor, he was told that Building Bloqs was a lovely idea, “but I am never going to make five times my money back off you guys”. And while Labour-run Enfield council has been good on other things, here the local politicians have just pointed to austerity as an excuse.  &#10;&#10;So Labour sticks to its old solution of public funds, and the Tories offer more market – and, meanwhile, Building Bloqs and other hopes of rebuilding a broken economy fade away. From the fall of Northern Rock in 2007 to September 2014, Britain lost a net total of 352,000 manufacturing jobs; London and the south-east shed 87,000 manufacturing posts, even while it gained 15,000 more financiers. Those figures tell you plenty about the new old economy that Britain is building.  &#10;&#10;After a pleasantly full and frank exchange over the weekend, the Enfield councillor in charge of regeneration has offered to think again about how he might help Building Bloqs. Here are some ideas for him – and for every area that has been stripped of a local economy: set up a register of local professionals who might offer their accountancy, legal and other expertise pro bono to companies such as Building Bloqs; ask local ventures to list the services and materials they need; hook up makerspaces to the local further education colleges to provide work experience and publicity; challenge the big banks to lend more money to genuinely local businesses; and finally, ask Ikea to use its empty lobbies to advertise places like Building Bloqs.  &#10;&#10;I wish Al, Arnaud and Alex every success. But rebuilding Britain’s economy must not rest on three men working their arses off and not knowing if they’ll be here this time next year.  	Aditya Chakrabortty: Social enterprise start-ups like Building Bloqs are exactly what our broken economy needs. But politicians, bankers and investors must play ball

None of us are unbiased, none removed from the question of power. We are social creatures who absorb the outlook and opinions of those with whom we associate, and unconciously echo them. Objectivity is impossible.  &#10;&#10;The illusion of neutrality is one of the reasons for the rotten state of journalism, as those who might have been expected to hold power to account drift thoughtlessly into its arms. But until I came across the scandal currently erupting in Canada, I hadn’t understood just how quickly standards are falling.  &#10;&#10;In 2013 reporters at CBC, Canada’s equivalent of the BBC, broke a major story. They discovered that RBC – Royal Bank of Canada – had done something cruel and unusual even by banking standards. It was obliging junior staff to train a group of temporary foreign workers, who would then be given the staff’s jobs. Just after the first report was aired, according to the website Canadaland, something odd happened: journalists preparing to expand on the investigation were summoned to a conference call with Amanda Lang, CBC’s senior business correspondent and a star presenter. The reporters she spoke to say she repeatedly attempted to scuttle the story, dismissing it as trivial and dull.  &#10;&#10;They were astonished. But not half as astonished as when they discovered the following, unpublished facts. First, that Lang had spoken at a series of events run or sponsored by RBC – for which she appears, on one occasion, to have been paid around 15,000 Canadian dollars. Second, that she was booked to speak at an event sponsored by the outsourcing company the bank had hired to implement the cruel practice exposed by her colleagues. Third, that her partner is a board member at RBC.  &#10;&#10;Lang then interviewed the bank’s chief executive on her own show. When he dismissed the story as unfair and misleading, she did not challenge him. That evening she uncritically repeated his talking points on CBC’s main current affairs programme. Her interests, again, were not revealed. Then she wrote a comment article for the Globe and Mail newspaper suggesting that her colleagues’ story arose from an outdated suspicion of business, was dangerous to Canada’s interests, and was nothing but “a sideshow”. Here’s what she said about the bank’s employment practices: “It’s called capitalism, and it isn’t a dirty word.”  &#10;&#10;Canadaland, which exposed Lang’s conflicts last week, found that other journalists at the broadcaster were furious, but too frightened to speak on the record. But after CBC tried to dismiss the scandal as “half-truths based on anonymous sources”, Kathy Tomlinson, the reporter who had broken the story about the bank, bravely spoke publicly to the website. The following morning, staff in her office arrived to find this message spelt out in magnets on their fridge: “Jesse Brown snitches get stitches”. Jesse Brown is Canadaland’s founder.  &#10;&#10;CBC refused to answer my questions, and I have not had a response from Lang. It amazes me that she remains employed by CBC, which has so far done nothing but bluster and berate its critics.  &#10;&#10;This is grotesque. But it’s symptomatic of a much wider problem in journalism: those who are supposed to scrutinise the financial and political elite are embedded within it. Many belong to a service-sector aristocracy, wedded metaphorically (sometimes literally) to finance. Often unwittingly, they amplify the voices of the elite, while muffling those raised against it.  &#10;&#10;A study by academics at the Cardiff School of Journalism examined the BBC Today programme’s reporting of the bank bailouts in 2008. It discovered that the contributors it chose were “almost completely dominated by stockbrokers, investment bankers, hedge fund managers and other City voices. Civil society voices or commentators who questioned the benefits of having such a large finance sector were almost completely absent from coverage.” The financiers who had caused the crisis were asked to interpret it.  &#10;&#10;The same goes for discussions about the deficit and the perceived need for austerity. The debate has been dominated by political and economic elites, while alternative voices – arguing that the crisis has been exaggerated, or that instead of cuts, the government should respond with Keynesian spending programmes or taxes on financial transactions, wealth or land – have scarcely been heard. Those priorities have changed your life: the BBC helped to shape the political consensus under which so many are now suffering.  &#10;&#10;The BBC’s business reporting breaks its editorial guidelines every day by failing to provide alternative viewpoints. Every weekday morning, the Today programme grovels to business leaders for 10 minutes. It might occasionally challenge them on the value or viability of their companies, but hardly ever on their ethics. Corporate critics are shut out of its business coverage – and almost all the rest.  &#10;&#10;On BBC News at Six, the Cardiff researchers found, business representatives outnumbered trade union representatives by 19 to one. “The BBC tends to reproduce a Conservative, Eurosceptic, pro-business version of the world,” the study said. This, remember, is where people turn when they don’t trust the corporate press.  &#10;&#10;While the way in which the media handle the stories that are covered is bad enough, the absence of coverage is even worse. If an issue does not divide the main political parties, it vanishes from view, though the parties now disagree on hardly anything. Another study reveals a near total collapse of environmental coverage on ITV and BBC news: it declined from 2.5% (ITV) and 1.6% (BBC) of total airtime in 2007 to, respectively, 0.2% and 0.3% in 2014. There were as many news stories on these outlets about Madeleine McCann in 2014 – seven years after her disappearance – as there were about all environmental issues put together.  &#10;&#10;Those entrusted to challenge power are the loyalists of power. They rage against social media and people such as Russell Brand, without seeing that the popularity of alternatives is a response to their own failures: their failure to expose the claims of the haut monde, their failure to enlist a diversity of opinion, their failure to permit the audience to see that another world is possible. If even the public sector broadcasters parrot the talking points of the elite, what hope is there for informed democratic choice?  &#10;&#10;• Twitter: @georgemonbiot.

In other words, over 1,200 Buffalo teachers union members could have had a boob job last year, at taxpayer expense.  &#10;&#10;The annual expenditure is staggering, given the district’s troubled financial situation, not to mention its sketchy academic performance.  &#10;&#10;In January 2014, the Buffalo News reported that the school district was grappling with a $50 million budget deficit for the 2013-14 school year.  &#10;&#10;“That gives us very little wiggle room to fund anything new,” Barbara Smith, the district’s chief financial officer, told the school board.  &#10;&#10;Except, of course, for a lot of new cosmetic medical procedures for teachers.  &#10;&#10;The “cosmetic rider” benefit has been offered to teachers for decades and has been scrutinized only recently due to the school district’s financial plight.  &#10;&#10;The school board has been unwilling to impose a new labor agreement without the rider, as allowed by law. So the district has been operating under the terms of an old agreement – which includes the cosmetic rider – that expired about 10 years ago.  &#10;&#10;Until the union agrees to a new contract without the perk, the school district will continue paying. That possibility has been discussed for years, but the union has never budged.  &#10;&#10;“There\'s no co-pay (for cosmetic procedures), so the school district ends up footing the entire bill,” The Atlantic reported in 2012.  &#10;&#10;Perhaps if the Buffalo school district produced great academic results, and students who were prepared for college or the working world upon graduation, taxpayers could justify such a cushy benefit for teachers.  &#10;&#10;But that’s clearly not the case.  &#10;&#10;The district recently boasted that its graduation rate improved from a miserable 47.8 percent to 56 percent. So slightly more than half of the students are now getting a diploma, which is hardly a reason to celebrate.  &#10;&#10;The district’s latest student proficiency numbers are ugly, as well.  &#10;&#10;According to the Buffalo News, only 12.2 percent of Buffalo students rated proficient or better on recent standardized English tests, while only 13.1 percent rated proficient or better in math.  &#10;&#10;So what has this teaching staff accomplished that merits a benefit as costly and wasteful as free cosmetic surgery?  &#10;&#10;The June 2014 union newsletter – appropriately named The Provocator – includes ads from three cosmetic service providers pedaling procedures like Botox, cosmetic breast and body contouring, facelifts, hair transplantation, and “medispa” treatments.  &#10;&#10;Those ads are bound to pay off for the providers, because the teachers can obtain their pricey services for free – at our expense, of course.  &#10;&#10;There is a chance that the cosmetic rider could finally be abolished through labor negotiations.  &#10;&#10;Most recently, an outside mediator proposed giving teachers an 11.8 percent pay increase, and in exchange they would pay a “small” amount toward their own health insurance. The proposal also calls for ending the plastic surgery coverage, according to the Buffalo News.  &#10;&#10;While completely eliminating the “cosmetic rider” from its benefits package would not plug the $50 million budget hole, the annual expense is an indication that the school board is not serious about reining in out of control spending, nor making sure every dollar is going directly towards the education of children.  	Even a $50 million budget deficit in the Buffalo school district couldn’t&#10;convince members of the Buffalo Federation of Teachers to cut down on their&#10;taxpayer-funded tummy tucks, breast lifts and nose jobs.&#10;&#10;

(AP/Elise Amendola)  &#10;&#10;If you think bullies are teenagers lurking on schoolyard playgrounds, think again. At least one is a grown-up walking the hallowed halls of Harvard University.  &#10;&#10;His name is Ben Edelman. He not only teaches there, but he earned several diplomas including a law degree at that storied institution of higher education. But Edelman seems to have adopted the word “higher” as his personal calling card. You see, he’s higher than you and me. Or at least he seems anxious to let you know it.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;A hardworking Chinese immigrant family found that out when the professor ordered a takeout meal of shredded chicken with spicy garlic sauce and three other dishes.  &#10;&#10;Edelman thought he was overcharged by $ 4 bucks ($ 1 dollar more for each dish), so he launched a relentless war on Ran Duan, who works with his parents at their restaurant, Sichuan Garden in Brookline. You can read the sordid details in a story at Boston.com where the website also published the unbelievable litany of Edelman’s intimidating and condescending emails to Duan. The prof’s remarks ooze with arrogance and conceit.  &#10;&#10;Edelman’s exchange with Duan has become a viral sensation, as it should. A Harvard professor vowing legal action over the sum of $ 4 dollars. Come on.  &#10;&#10;The professor has now apologized for his treatment of Duan and his family, but his emails will leave you shaking your head in disbelief that someone so supposedly “learned” could be so seemingly insufferable. Maybe that’s what a Harvard education gets you these days –a degree in imperiousness.  &#10;&#10;Arrogance aside, the professor’s persistent threats of legal action constitute a shameful campaign of bullying. He uses his knowledge of the law --at least his tortured interpretation of it-- for a purpose that can only be described as abusive. It turns out, he has done this before to a different restaurant.  &#10;&#10;Bullies tend to target the weak and vulnerable. For Edelman to use his advantage as a lawyer to berate the Duan family who have come from nothing as immigrants and are trying their best to make a living running a restaurant is, in a word, unconscionable. During one email exchange, Duan asked the professor, “you seem like a smart man…don’t you have better things to do?” Bullies usually don’t.  &#10;&#10;For all I know, Edelman is a pretty good professor. That does not make him a good person. Clinical psychiatrists might find him to be an interesting case study in how living in the Harvard bubble can distort even the most agile of minds. Sometimes intellectuals take themselves too seriously. Sequestered from the experiences of the average man, they can lack common sense, kindness and decency. Edelman seems bereft of them all.  &#10;&#10;There is a reason why places like Harvard are called “ivory towers”. All too often, they envelop an artificial atmosphere where intellectuals are disconnected from the practical concerns of everyday life. So, it should be no surprise when guys like Ben Edelman explode like a bomb on some poor immigrant family trying to make a buck with the sweat of their brow. Fortunately, academic elitism is not contagious.  &#10;&#10;Teaching at Harvard may be a lofty achievement in the egg-head world. But professor Edelman seems to lack the one quality which elevates people above all other primates: compassion. He might gain a measure of humility and understanding by getting a real job. Might I suggest washing dishes in a Chinese restaurant?  &#10;&#10;The next time I visit the Boston area, I’ll skip Harvard Yard. Instead, I plan to drop by the Sichuan Garden to try their sautéed prawns with roasted chili and peanut sauce.  &#10;&#10;And I won’t check the bill.  	If you think bullies are teenagers lurking on schoolyard playgrounds, think&#10;again. At least one is a grown-up walking the hallowed halls of Harvard&#10;University. His name is Ben Edelman. ...&#10;&#10;
032-californiablackwomanussenateka	guardian	2015-01-14T15:54:13Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/14/california-black-woman-us-senate-kamala-harris	Cheryl Contee	If California truly leads the nation, we can elect a black woman to the US Senate	Here in California, it’s been a blockbuster week in politics: Barbara Boxer is finally stepping down as perma-Senator after over 20 years; former San Francisco mayor and current lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom is running for governor; and attorney general Kamala Harris gunning for Boxer’s soon-to-be- vacated seat. Why does it matter?  &#10;&#10;There’s certainly something compelling about Harris’ daring bid for US Senate: there are only one in five senators are female in this Congress; and there are only two black Senators currently (Cory Booker of New Jersey and Tim Scott from South Carolina). If Harris won, she not only would contribute to the growing number of women in power, but having three actual black senators at one time would make history because, to date, two is the best we’ve been able to achieve as a nation. In America’s entire history, only eight black people have ever been senators and of those, only half were actually elected, rather than appointed. Yet African-Americans make up about 13% of the population, according to the 2013 census. True proportional representation would see black senators in the double digits in Congress.  &#10;&#10;California has outsized importance in the US economy: on its own, it is the world’s eighth-largest economy, just behind booming Brazil but ahead of Russia and Italy. California’s contributions are one of the chief reasons the US remains the world’s biggest economy ... and a black woman is poised to be one of the most nationally influential politicians in the state.  &#10;&#10;California’s internal public policy tussles – and its standard more-liberal- than-the-nation solutions – often help lead the rest of the nation and the world forward, be it on pollution standards, minimum wage increases, medical marijuana legalization, organic produce certification, healthcare access for the uninsured, public-private technology innovation such as iHubs and tax breaks that encourage local production of zero-emission Teslas, same sex marriage and wetlands protections such as the CA Coastal Act of 1976. California’s politicians can bring to Washington the ability to combine strong, safe regulatory experience with a booming economy and environmental protections, offering a compelling counter-point to Republicans who argue otherwise.  &#10;&#10;And, with the exception of Jerry Brown’s first stint as governor from 1975-1983, California internal top politics has been tended to be dominated by southern California figures like Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger – but Harris (and Newsom) are both northern California people through and through. Instead of Hollywood values and priorities holding sway in the state, northern California’s tech-powered financial and cultural strength may finally have a chance to drive the state’s politics . And while Boxer, her fellow senator Dianne Feinstein and House minority leader Nancy Pelosi all hail from northern California, they spend much of their time in Washington DC – so Harris’s move to DC will provide us with a new generation of representatives steeped in the area’s emerging tech-focused culture.  &#10;&#10;While I believe California has much to gain from politicians like Newsom and Harris who see their work as largely cooperative and people-focused – as opposed to the ideological culture warriors who normally represent us in national policy debates – there’s a long road ahead for each. Harris, for instance, may have to contend with billionaire Tom Steyer and former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa in a Democratic primary (and Villaraigosa would make history of his own). But Harris is likely to have a lot of support behind her and – being young, at 50 – a run now for Senate still leaves the door open to run for governor 10 or 20 years down the road. After all, stranger things have happened in CA politics: who would have thought that B-list actor Ronald Reagan would rise from California to become the GOP’s iconic president, or that Jerry Brown, now 76-years-old, would become governor again after over 30 years?

Cameron’s people insist he won’t come on unless the Greens are there too. Listen carefully and there is a faint creaking noise, the sound of a politician trying to wind back the great clock of politics. In Cameron’s case, he wants it back to the happy days before Gordon Brown conceded the prime ministerial veto on TV debates. It might just work.  &#10;&#10;Rule one in any prime minister’s handbook is never give up an advantage. In an election, that’s what being prime minister is – an advantage. That’s why it took 12 general elections between most voters having access to a television in 1964 and the first (and last?) television debate in 2010. Yet debates are as old as politics itself, and putting them on TV has had that “well, obviously” feel to it ever since the first US presidential debate in 1960. It must have helped perpetuate the brand, that first contest, for it was between the two men whose lives and deaths shadowed the rest of the American century: the beautiful young upstart John F Kennedy and the so much less telegenic, even rather sweaty, Richard Nixon.  &#10;&#10;Cameron’s people have been trying to back out of TV debates in 2015 almost since the lights went down on the last debate of the last election campaign. It has been a carefully played, inch-by-inch retreat covered by protestations of enthusiasm, framed in the context of a wider concern for the state of democracy. Last August he ruminated on the way they sucked the oxygen out of the last campaign (and poured a good deal of it into the Lib Dems’ camp). Now he says he is standing up for the right of the Greens, excluded for – according to Ofcom – not being big enough.  &#10;&#10;Questioning the value of the debates is easy. The doyen of electoral coverage, David Dimbleby, who chaired the BBC session, said later that he thought they didn’t let in as much light as when politicians were made to face the voters on their own in the kind of Question Time event that, as it happens, he also chairs. There’s no doubt that accidental encounters with ordinary people – Brown’s “bigoted woman”, or Margaret Thatcher being confronted over the sinking of the Belgrano – have earned a place in history as moments of truth that have told a bigger story.  &#10;&#10;There is something rather odd about the “one of these people will be prime minister” hype before a debate that has been widened to include Farage. But, of course, the debates aren’t about debating in the traditional sense of the word, even when they are between two very different versions of the future, as they were in Scotland. What really mattered in those brutal encounters between Alex Salmond and Alistair Darling was the extraordinary depth of Darling’s antipathy to Salmond and, for a while, the unexpected haplessness of Salmond under pressure. That first debate will always be remembered as the moment the rabbit bit the car.  &#10;&#10;All the same, Cameron’s opponents cannot take victory for granted. They accuse him of running scared. The Twittersphere throbs with shouts of “frit”. It is a charge that might have a price for the Tory leader. It will certainly disconcert his less politically savvy supporters. But mainly it will just confirm the prejudices of those who were never going to vote Conservative anyway.  &#10;&#10;What it does prove, if proof were needed, is that the Tories are running a core vote strategy. If the broadcasters find the nerve to go ahead anyway, which is a punt in itself, an empty podium would not look good. But try to imagine the view from the perspective of a Tory strategist: the bill for looking frit is tiny compared with the enduring burden of being savaged by Farage. For Cameron, the strategist would reckon, it would be like being assessed for a job by someone who had watched you in conversation with the pub bore. Putting the two together is on a par with divorce proceedings where the party who has walked out stands and shouts a string of excuses unconnected with the facts in a way that is somehow illogically appealing. Just say you’ve gone off him!  &#10;&#10;And, of course, that’s why it must be made to happen. Let’s hear Cameron talking to both wings of his party at once. And just as importantly, please, please let’s have the Greens in the room too. It really would be an outrage not to.  	Anne Perkins: First thoughts: For the prime minister, encountering the Ukip leader in the TV debates could be akin to a grilling from a pub bore
034-cameronobamabanencryptionimpro	guardian	2015-01-18T21:17:16Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/17/cameron-obama-ban-encryption-improve-cybersecurity	Trevor Timm	Obama and Cameron’s ‘solutions’ for cybersecurity will make the internet worse	The current state of the US and UK governments’ ass-backwards approach to cybersecurity was on full display this week – culminating with British Prime Minister David Cameron and President Obama meeting to discuss the issue at the White House on Friday. When it comes to cybersecurity, it seems the UK and US want to embrace every crazy idea except what we know actually works.  &#10;&#10;The UK’s Cameron suggested earlier in the week he wants to outlaw certain forms of encryption, which could potentially lead to some of the world’s most popular messaging apps (like iMessage and WhatsApp) being banned in the UK. That speech had been ridiculed from all angles for the past few days, with various experts labeling it a nightmare for Internet security – on par with authoritarian regimes such as Russia and China – and economically devastating for the British information technology industry.  &#10;&#10;Meanwhile, the White House has proposed a huge expansion of penalties under the highly-controversial law that was used to prosecute Reddit co-founder and privacy rights advocate Aaron Swartz. If passed, the administration’s proposal could further criminalize mundane Internet activity – for example, potentially allowing for a ten-year jail sentence for sharing your HBO GO password – all to supposedly target foreign hackers that the law would likely never reach.  &#10;&#10;Less than 24 hours before Cameron-Obama the meeting, the Guardian published a secret report based on previously unreleased Snowden documents showing that the US government is fully aware that encryption is vital for security, and that the government risked leaving themselves vulnerable if they didn’t start implementing it on their own systems quicker. The British government likely knows this too: many of their employees use email encryption; and UK even recommend citizens use encryption to protect their data on a government website.  &#10;&#10;At the press conference after the meeting, Obama commendably didn’t embrace Cameron’s proposal when asked about it, and even Cameron seemed to at least appear to back off his own anti-encryption proclamation, saying he’s “not trying to enunciate some new doctrine.”  &#10;&#10;But just because Cameron’s been proven to be technically illiterate and may be attempting to publicly back away from his most radical proposal, that doesn’t mean that he won’t later push forward. FBI director Jim Comey proposed similar legislation to Cameron’s just a few months ago, and Cameron used eerily similar talking points in Washington on Friday as Comey did in late 2014. Plus, the rest of Cameron’s plan is downright scary for Internet privacy even without a formal encryption ban.  &#10;&#10;And then there’s the White House’s so-called solution to the cybersecurity problem, which they unveiled earlier this week. President Obama introduced it saying we had to do something about incidents like the headline-grabbing Sony hack, or the juvenile hijacking of US Central Command’s twitter account – but what he didn’t say was that those proposals wouldn’t have stopped those attacks at all.  &#10;&#10;Part of the Obama administration’s proposal would dramatically expand the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the oft-abused and notorious statute that the Justice Department used to threaten the late Internet activist Aaron Swartz with 35 years in jail. (Aaron later took his own life while awaiting trial.) The CFAA already has incredibly harsh penalties, so much so that there’s been a movement for years to reduce them. And how the administration thinks increasing CFAA penalties is going to worry either North Korean hackers or ISIS sympathizers (or more likely pranksters) who take advantage of negligent password practices is anyone’s guess.  &#10;&#10;It would also put countless security researchers at further risk of prosecution, the exact type of people the government should consulting with before making these ill-thought proposals, not driving underground.  &#10;&#10;At the same time, Congress has re-introduced their annual “info-sharing” cybersecurity bill, which is really just a thinly-veiled way to siphon off more of Americans’ private data without court oversight. As EFF put it, the bill “offered new authorities that could be abused by companies to spy on users, and offered broad legal immunity for disclosing the information obtained with the government. Sometimes they even granted companies the ability to ‘hack back’ ...a perfect storm threatening our online privacy.” The President’s alternative bill is a bit less sweeping, but not by much.  &#10;&#10;So, Congress and Obama seem to be finally on the same page about something: harsher penalties that won’t reach the hackers they were worried about and invasive “info-sharing” that doesn’t come close to solving existing problems. God forbid there be a full rebirth of the US-UK relationship, or that both sides of the Atlantic seek a full, two-state ban on encryption. Even full government gridlock would be better than that.  	Trevor Timm: Drafting policies to imprison people who share an HBO GO password? Eliminating end-to-end data encryption? They can’t be serious
035-canbreatheobamalastchancech	aljazeera	Thu, 04 Dec 2014 02:24:29 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/can-breathe-obama-last-chance-ch-20141248599193130.html	Jason A Johnson 	We can't breathe: Obama's last chance for change 	No one in the United States is actually surprised that a grand jury in New York City decided not to indict Daniel Pantaleo for the death of Eric Garner. In the same way that few Americans, regardless of political leanings were surprised when Officer Darren Wilson was not indicted for killing Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, just over a week ago.  &#10;&#10;The proximity of these two rulings, and the subsequent protests and civil unrest that have occurred in their wake, however, is an opportunity for President Barack Obama to make lasting and significant changes in the fundamental principles governing the US. The question will be does he have the political capital to do it?  &#10;&#10;Garner was killed in July during what was an unpleasant. but fairly typical interaction between minorities and police in the US. He was accused by local police of selling "loosies" or cigarettes in boxes that hadn't been properly taxed and when he told the officers that he wasn't selling them and was tired of being harassed, the situation turned grim.  &#10;&#10;He was quickly surrounded by several officers, and Officer Pantaleo put Garner in a chokehold and helped force him down onto the ground. Garner screamed that he couldn't breathe but despite his protests police continued to hold his neck in order to handcuff him, and when it became apparent that he had stopped breathing, the four EMTs on the scene made no effort to revive him.  &#10;&#10;This entire episode was caught on video by a friend of Garner's and its viral spread helped spur New York authorities to actually convene a grand jury of 25 New York citizens. The grand jury, however, decided that despite the visual evidence, and despite the city coroner declaring Garner's death a homicide, that there was not enough evidence to warrant a full trial. Thousands of Americans of all ages and colours took to the streets in a series of spontaneous protests across the country.  &#10;&#10;It's easy from the outside to look at these protests and assume that this is a dangerous and destabilising tipping point; that there is a new wave of violence against minorities that has finally reached a point of no return. This is not entirely true.  &#10;&#10;Violence against minorities, either directly sanctioned by, or tacitly tolerated by the federal government is the norm in the US, not an anomaly. From slavery to the massacre of Native Americans to rampant racial terrorism against African Americans, the US has not stopped its bloody relationship with violence and people of colour.  &#10;&#10;While African Americans only make up 13 percent of the population they account for over 30 percent of all police killings in 2012 alone. When you combine this kind of history with racial discrimination in sentencing, arrests, fines, jail time, where African Americans routinely receive longer, harsher and less lenient penalties than whites for the same crimes, it is hard to simply say that the cases of Eric Garner (or Michael Brown, or Tamir Rice or John Crawford) are new or isolated incidents. The US criminal justice system isn't broken, it's working exactly the way it was intended to work, and it was never written, implemented or designed to provide justice or equality for African Americans.  &#10;&#10;However what is different in this case is that it's not just African Americans protesting, a significant number of white, Latino and Asian Americans have flooded the streets of New York protesting the Garner ruling, shutting down major highways, malls and even disrupting the annual Christmas tree lighting.  &#10;&#10;At its core, police violence is a white American problem, not a black one. The only way this tide of violence can be stemmed is if white Americans who are angry about and stand against institutional racism and discrimination, are willing to directly confront white Americans who still support the way these institutions are run.  &#10;&#10;Solutions to institutional racism and police violence can't be dropped off at the doors of African Americans any longer, the white American majority must take some responsibility.  &#10;&#10;Beyond that, it is time for the president to take bolder steps to address systematic inequality in sentencing and policing across the US. President Obama has always been partial to piecemeal strategies. While his rhetoric is often bold and sweeping, the hostility of the Republican Congress, mixed with his own political personality, has often led to marginal policy changes.  &#10;&#10;On Monday, he convened a commission of civil rights leaders and unveiled plans to put more shoulder cameras on police officers' uniforms and thoroughly review Programme 1033, which allows local police departments to get free access to surplus military equipment. And while those are fine first steps, neither would have saved Garner's life or changed the decision of the grand jury.  &#10;&#10;The police did not have heavy militarised equipment but they employed a physical chokehold method that had been declared illegal by the New York police department for over 20 years, but that too wasn't enough to warrant a trial. While shoulder cameras are known to limit cases of abuse and harassment, the Garner case shows that they do not guarantee the police will be held accountable.  &#10;&#10;The only way that the president can do something about these events and the frustration felt by the public is to actually demand that the Department of Justice indict and conduct trials in some of these cases. President Obama has no trouble prosecuting "terrorists" and "whistle blowers" or those deemed to have spied on the US. He could certainly bring the power of the federal government to investigate and indict cases of police violence.  &#10;&#10;President Obama is not all powerful, but he is certainly much more capable than he has shown thus far in acting on the issues he feels are priorities for the US.  &#10;&#10;If Obama truly wants to establish a legacy beyond immigration and Obamacare he needs to make large spectacular displays of investigating and indicting officers who engage in misconduct, especially in cases that result in the death of unarmed African Americans. If he doesn't, the worst part of his final two years as president won't just come from the Republican House and Senate, but from millions of Americans, most of whom voted for him, marching through the streets having lost faith in his ability to lead.  	Police violence is a white American problem, not a black one.&#10;&#10;
036-cansolarpowerreplaceoilmid	aljazeera	Sun, 07 Dec 2014 12:58:50 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/can-solar-power-replace-oil-mid-201412752357541154.html	Vicente Lopez-Ibor Mayor	Can solar power replace oil in the Middle East?	The rise of shale has posed a rare challenge to Middle Eastern oil, culminating in a global oil price war and moving OPEC members to slash profits to retain market share. But at a time when OPEC's hegemony over the oil markets has been challenged, let us not forget there is another abundant natural energy resource the Middle East possesses - the sun.  &#10;&#10;The abundance of sunlight (and therefore solar power) offers Middle Eastern energy producers an opportunity to achieve first-move advantage in a market that appears to be the longer-term future of energy. In light of recent instability in oil markets, the importance of alternative renewable energies, particularly solar, has become all the more pronounced. The drop in oil prices has precipitated an efficiency rush in energy production in all producer nations. In the US, oil producers are leaving no stone unturned in the hunt to become as efficient and sustainable as possible.  &#10;&#10;In Europe, there is a renewed push for renewable energy and some countries like the UK are also pursuing nuclear energy as a longer-term solution. In the Gulf, there are similar measures taking place to become more efficient in a more competitive energy market, and increasingly, they are turning to solar to achieve it.  &#10;&#10;Domestic budgets  &#10;&#10;The Gulf states remains one of the biggest oil producers in the world, and make up the biggest exporting members of OPEC, especially Saudi Arabia. While some of these countries can afford to swallow current oil prices for now, they will nonetheless find it difficult to maintain their domestic budgets - all OPEC countries chose to cut prices in order to hold onto market share, this means slashing profit. It would not be unprecedented for these countries to encounter domestic trouble.  &#10;&#10;The other, more serious concerns for these major oil producers, is the increasing consumer demand in their own countries. In past decades, the region has been able to sustain luxury alongside completely inefficient energy policies through government subsidies. But the entire energy outlook for the region is changing rapidly.  &#10;&#10;Rising populations, a growing middle class, industry diversification and increasing consumerism has turned a number of countries in the Gulf region into major energy consumers. In Saudi Arabia, oil accounts for over 65 percent of all electricity production, in Kuwait it is 71 percent, in Lebanon it is 94 percent and in Yemen it's an astonishing 100 percent. This represents an energy policy that is inefficient and in the long run - unsustainable.  &#10;&#10;Saudi Arabia is the biggest petroleum consumer in the region, it is the world's second biggest consumer of total primary energy, 60 percent of which is petroleum-based. But most importantly, it paints a distressing future for the region’s oil export industry. If consumer demand continues to grow, it will eventually result in downward pressure on oil exports and could start affecting subsidies. Without a robust and efficient energy balance in the region, it will inevitably lead to these producer nations becoming less profitable with a weaker export outlook.  &#10;&#10;And with competitors in the oil market like Russia, Iran and the North American shale, this is a long-term dynamic that will undermine Middle East's global energy dominance.  &#10;&#10;However, the possibilities associated with harnessing Middle Eastern solar energy could be a game-changer. Solar is becoming much cheaper to invest in, and now has an established and ever improving infrastructure. Substantial investment in solar will act as a shield for the region's more valued commodity; oil. Saudi Arabia alone for example, could have made $43.8bn in additional oil revenue in 2013 were it not for its spiralling domestic consumption.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;It also would have acted as a massive stimulus to the country's finances. Earlier this year, Saudi Aramco, the state oil company, announced it would be making solar energy investments across the country in an attempt to diversify the country's energy supplies. It is also expected to conserve the country's oil resources primarily for export.  &#10;&#10;It has been a slow process but is nonetheless an important one for the future of the solar energy sector. One of the biggest success variables for any solar energy project is not just investment, but location. The Middle East's solar industry is one of the most economically sustainable and acts as the best conserver of the region's oil resources.  &#10;&#10;Investment opportunity  &#10;&#10;It is also a very strong investment opportunity for those looking to invest in a sustainable, long-term energy sector with a ready market and significantly lower start-up costs then depleting energy exploration.  &#10;&#10;But these new developments would also have another important advantage for the Middle East; a cleaner environment. The use of petroleum for electricity generation has made the Middle East's air quality one of the poorest in the world. Twenty-nine of the world's most polluted cities are in the MENA region.  &#10;&#10;Recent energy challenges could have very costly consequences for the region if left unaddressed, but they could also reap huge rewards if met with robust energy reforms and additional investment in alternative energies, especially solar. And there are positive signs for the region. Saudi Arabia alone has announced a $109bn investment plan to generate a third of its electricity. Qatar has also made solar energy agreements with major renewable energy companies as part of its commitments to the Solar GCC alliance.  &#10;&#10;How these measures materialise over the next decade or so remains to be seen, but there is room for optimism. What's more, the Middle East's unrivalled solar potential means that theoretically, it can become more then a just a world leader in fossil fuel production, it can become a world leader in renewable energy production as well.  	The Middle East can achieve first-move advantage in a market that appears to&#10;be the longer-term future of energy.&#10;&#10;
037-catastrophebritishsitcomsgloba	guardian	2015-01-20T19:20:25Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/20/catastrophe-british-sitcoms-global-audience	Catherine Shoard	The push for a global audience could be a catastrophe for British sitcoms	Pulling, Sharon Horgan’s sitcom about three venal women in Penge, south London, was so good it got you evangelical. I bought the boxset for friends and had to explain it was because it was brilliant, not because it reminded me of them. It was funny and unfiltered and bleak enough to take your breath away. So while I’m cheered that she’s got a new show on television, the rave reviews for the first episode make me feel like a teetotaller at a lock-in. I just don’t get it. Pulling was a classic British sitcom in that it was riven with self-loathing, and its situation – the gap between its characters’ desire to pull and their capacity to do so – inherently fraught and fruitful.  &#10;&#10;In Catastrophe, Horgan plays a woman who gets pregnant after a brief fling with a visiting American, played by the standup Rob Delaney. Already, this feels Working Title-ready: a sit- that more readily begets rom than com. Then there’s the detail.  &#10;&#10;In, say, the similarly plotted Knocked Up there was some tension over whether a groomed high-flier and an unemployed stoner would be able to make it to the delivery room. In Catastrophe they seem ideally suited from the get-go. He’s a successful businessman who wants to move to the UK, marry her and sit through awful suppers with her friends. They are a happy couple expecting a baby. They have hot sex and give each other justifiable compliments. This is not how I want my British sitcoms to be.  &#10;&#10;I don’t want them to be like Friends – soaps in disguise, scripted by a crack squad of gag writers. I don’t want them to be Americanised; to be glossy and hopeful. I switched over to Catastrophe after my first encounter with Broadchurch, whose bath/bathwater/kitchen sink plotting – and its makeover job on Dorset – suggest similarly transatlantic influences and ambitions. But it did at least feature Olivia Colman weeping her way through some horrible intercourse: a dash of Peep Show in an hour of wacky trash. The export market is important. Telly and films are some of the things we do best. But it’d be a shame if our eagerness to sell overseas was a slippery slope. Palatable doesn’t mean losing flavour.  &#10;&#10;I love the smell of kebab in the morning; it smells like home. I live in a largely Turkish part of north London famed for its grand parade of grill restaurants. The carcinogenic whiff wanders all the way up the side street to our house; smoke fuelled by the appetites of those who come from all round town to guzzle the meat feasts (top tip: Gökyüzü’s jumbo platter – stuffs six for £44).  &#10;&#10;But over the past few years the area has had an influx of non-Turkish types – vegetarians, vegans even, who, while they can have a (delicious) charred aubergine in the restaurants, aren’t massively catered for by the shops. The 24-hour grocer has a massive halal display as its front counter; two doors down is a great Greek butcher with a hopeful window sticker: “Pork. Go on, give it a try! It’s tasty!”  &#10;&#10;Last Monday, everything changed. A new independent store appeared to plug the gap precisely. There is quinoa. There are multiple types of Italian pasta. A range of challenging beans. Staggeringly expensive organic baby food. And an array of tofu products and mushroom-protein burger mixes. For a long while now, I’ve felt there is no better place to live than Harringay, a model of cross-cultural tolerance and integration. Now, even vegans are welcome.  &#10;&#10;The big movie debate at the moment is over American Sniper, Clint Eastwood’s gung-ho Iraq drama. Does its whopping box office (and six shock Oscar nods) indicate a creeping Islamophobia? Or simply how out of touch liberal Hollywood is with mainstream American taste? People have protested that the Iraqi soldiers are treated like chess pieces, mere ciphers, cannon fodder. This is true. But it is not limited to the film’s baddies. Clint has also attracted criticism for cutting corners and using fake babies rather than troublesome real ones, resulting in some conspicuously plastic offspring for Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller. This is just what film directors do. For them, everybody is basically a superannuated dolly.

Then let’s drop the contraception con	Clarity has never been a strong point at the Vatican. This is, after all, an institution that has chosen for centuries to communicate with its followers via erudite documents written in Latin, which must be first translated and then interpreted for us, the faithful in the pew.  &#10;&#10;But even by its own standards, this week’s papal pronouncements have been bewildering. We thought that, whatever else wasn’t clear, one thing we did know was that the church doesn’t approve of contraception. But during his in- flight press conference en route home from his Philippines trip, we hear Pope Francis telling us that we don’t after all have to breed “like rabbits”.  &#10;&#10;What he is saying, it transpires, is that Catholics should use one of several “natural”, church-approved methods of contraception. But this it seems to me only serves to focus attention on something illogical at the heart of the church’s traditional teaching on birth control, which is: if the point is that God should have space to “intervene” and make a pregnancy happen, surely He/She can intervene just as effectively via a torn condom or a missed pill as via a mistaken calendar calculation.  &#10;&#10;One of Pope Francis’s strongest messages during his Philippines trip seemed to be that today’s families are under threat from efforts to redefine what “family” is, but I wonder whether the truth isn’t that the Catholic church is under threat from an avalanche of common sense that is now unstoppable.  &#10;&#10;The truth is that the pope – a charismatic and decent-seeming guy whose finger is a good deal closer to the people’s pulse than his predecessor’s was – is tying himself in knots trying to appear “modern” at the same time as adhering to official teaching. And it simply won’t wash. The church has been peddling a nonsense on contraception for almost 50 years. The vast majority of us church- going, “faithful” Catholics have voted with our gonads and ignored it, and at some point (soon, please!) Rome is going to have to admit it has been wrong, and that the “contraceptive culture” is not about a lack of respect for human life, it’s quite simply about a sensible realisation that most couples can raise two, three or four children better, in every way, than they can raise 10, 11 or 12.  &#10;&#10;But aha, the pope would say, here I am being a cultural colonialist, seeking to impose my first-world notions on those of a developing community that has a very different perspective. Well, actually, no I’m not, because Catholic clerics can look anywhere on the planet and what they will see is that with economic improvements and women’s rights comes a reduction in family size. When people have choice, this is the choice they tend to make. Those who aren’t making it are those who aren’t empowered, not those with a different worldview.  &#10;&#10;What we are witnessing in this papacy is a church that realises how far out of step it is with modern thinking, and is increasingly keen on getting into line. At the moment it’s beginning to talk the talk, but the footwork is still failing, mostly because a bit of honesty and a few U-turns are required, and most cardinals and bishops aren’t yet ready for that. The question is, when will they be ready? Because my fear is that if they leave it too long they’ll have left it too late. The churches might still be full today, but will they be full tomorrow? Even if I am prepared to hang on in there, albeit by my fingertips, I don’t know if the same can be said for my children. Your instincts are right, Pope Francis. Now, though, we need some action.  	Joanna Moorhead: Whatever the pope says, the vast majority of us have already voted with our gonads and ignored the church’s nonsense

(AP/Marko Drobnjakovic)  &#10;&#10;An Army chaplain was punished for discussing matters of faith and quoting from the Bible during a suicide prevention training session with the 5th Ranger Training Battalion -- leading to outrage from religious liberty groups and a Georgia congressman.  &#10;&#10;Chaplain Joseph Lawhorn was issued a Letter of Concern that accused him of advocating for Christianity and “using Christian scripture and solutions” during a Nov. 20th training session held at the University of North Georgia.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;“You provided a two-sided handout that listed Army resources on one side and a biblical approach to handling depression on the other side,” Col. David Fivecoat, the commander of the Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade at Ft. Benning, Georgia, wrote in the letter to the chaplain. “This made it impossible for those in attendance to receive the resource information without also receiving the biblical information.”  &#10;&#10;The Christian chaplain was warned to be “careful to avoid any perception you are advocating one system of beliefs over another.”  &#10;&#10;However, attorneys for the chaplain, along with religious advocacy groups, say his comments are covered by the “right of conscience clause” that was passed in last year’s National Defense Authorization Act, section 533.  &#10;&#10;CLICK HERE TO JOIN TODD ON FACEBOOK FOR CONSERVATIVE CONVERSATION!  &#10;&#10;Chaplain Lawhorn was ordered to appear in the colonel’s office on Thanksgiving Day where he was personally handed the Letter of Concern.  &#10;&#10;Based on Col. Fivecoat’s version of events -- you would’ve thought Chaplain Lawhorn had turned the suicide prevention workshop into a Billy Graham Crusade. However, that’s not what happened.  &#10;&#10;During the course of conducting the training session, Ron Crews, the endorsing agent for military chaplains for Grace Churches International, explained, the chaplain discussed his own struggles with depression and the methods and techniques he personally used to combat depression. He said the chaplain did provide a handout with religious resources — but he also provided a handout with non-religious resources.  &#10;&#10;“The chaplain did nothing wrong,” said Crews. “At no time did he say his was the only or even the preferred way of dealing with depression. And at no time did he deny the validity of any other method.”  &#10;&#10;Lawhorn is one of the few Army chaplains to wear the Ranger Tab and Crews said it was through that identification that he shared his story about depression.  &#10;&#10;“His story involves his faith journey,” Crews said. “He was simply being a great Army chaplain - in ministering to his troops and providing first hand how he has dealt with depression in the past. That’s what chaplains do. They bare their souls for their soldiers in order to help them with crises they may be going through.”  &#10;&#10;However, someone in the training session complained to the Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers. That complaint led to a story on the Huffington Post.  &#10;&#10;Michael Berry, an attorney with Liberty Institute, a law firm that handles religious liberty cases, is representing the chaplain. He said the person who filed the complained “exploited” the chaplain’s “vulnerability.”  &#10;&#10;“It took a great amount of courage for Chaplain Lawhorn to discuss his own personal battle with depression,” Berry said. “At no time did he consider himself to be in a ‘preacher’ role.” Berry called on the Army to rescind the Letter of Concern — calling it a violation of the chaplain’s constitutional rights.  &#10;&#10;“Not only is it lawful for a chaplain to talk about matters of faith and spirituality and religion in a suicide prevention training class - but the Army policy encourages discussion of matters of faith and spiritual wellness,” Berry told me. “The fact that one person in the class was offended changes nothing.”  &#10;&#10;Congressman Doug Collins, a Republican lawmaker from Georgia, whose district includes the area where the training session took place, fired off a letter to Col. Fivecoat expressing his concerns in the matter.  &#10;&#10;“I find it counterintuitive to have someone lead a suicide prevention course but prohibit them from providing their personal testimony,” Collins wrote.  &#10;&#10;He cited the Army’s Equal Opportunity policy and how it was set up to protect the personal beliefs of military personnel.  &#10;&#10;“I fear Chaplain Lawhorn’s freedom of expression was improperly singled out,” he wrote.  &#10;&#10;Liberty Institute tells me the Army will allow me to speak with the chaplain — but not right now. And Col. Fivecoat sent me an email telling me that he would not be able to comment at this point.  &#10;&#10;If I’m reading between the lines — that Letter of Concern comes pretty close to accusing the chaplain of proselytizing. Crews agrees with my assessment.  &#10;&#10;“The bottom line is — that is exactly what they are trying to accuse him of — when nothing could be further from the truth,” Crews told me. “The military leadership needs to commend Chaplain Lawhorn, not condemn him.”  &#10;&#10;Berry said Americans should be shocked and outraged over Chaplain Lawhorn’s punishment.  &#10;&#10;"His job is to save lives — and he’s being punished for trying to do his job,” Berry said. “He’s doing everything he can to save them - and yet now they’re trying to say - the way you’re doing it offends me."  &#10;&#10;I find it both repulsive and heartbreaking to know that we have a military that frowns upon a chaplain using a Bible to save a soldier’s life.

French magazine Charlie Hebdo was brutally attacked by three self-proclaimed al-Qaeda envoys, all French citizens. Cabu, one of the cartoonists killed, was the regular host of Recre A2, the French equivalent of Sesame Street, back in the 1980s. A whole generation of French people who grew up with him will all ask the same question: Why would Cabu, the debonair monument to French popular culture, have to die for his irreverence, his caustic humour? Are we not allowed to laugh any more?  &#10;&#10;Cabu died with several other colleagues, alongside the brave policemen who tried to stop the carnage. As the attack took place, the assailants allegedly mentioned their connection to Yemen, and that the "Prophet had been avenged."  &#10;&#10;In 2006, the magazine had been republishing the infamous caricatures of Prophet Muhammad, in solidarity with the Danish cartoonists who has been sent death threats. As the French political scene gathers to condemn the attack in what journalists call "unite nationale", an all-partisan unity against acts of terrorism, scores of French people took to the streets that evening in a show of solidarity. Their slogan Je Suis Charlie (I am Charlie), is a clear reminder that hate will not prevail, and that freedom of speech is paramount to French culture.  &#10;&#10;Incredulity  &#10;&#10;Since it is the case, let us change the scenario, and say that a Bolivian leftist magazine, notorious for its coverage against wars of any kind, had been targeted by a vicious commando-like attack by al-Qaeda. Would this scenario not spark incredulity among most people?  &#10;&#10;Would observers not wonder why on earth Bolivia had been attacked in such a brutal manner? Would it be because it is a coveted beacon of freedom that evil terrorists want to harm? Or perhaps because Bolivia's populist ideals and freedom of expression are a threat to Islam worldwide?  &#10;&#10;Those narratives just wouldn't add up, unless there was more to the story than what a convenient "unite nationale" would want to stir public opinion away from.  &#10;&#10;Bolivia is not currently involved in Mali and Iraq, nor does it harbour a 5 million population of many disenfranchised Muslims. Bolivia is not the new military BFF of the US, which has been waging an invisible war using drone strikes in various parts of the world, including Yemen, where two of today's attackers were trained. That is what makes the whole difference between France and Bolivia.  &#10;&#10;As the French political scene and its dutiful self-censoring media all cry crocodile tears after the attack, dots need to be connected. This is what journalism should be about.  &#10;&#10;France and the US are at war: Their main achievement has been to obliterate this narrative from their own populations, which is why today’s attack is met with naive incredulity. One of the suspects, Cherif Kouachi, had already been sentenced to prison in 2008 for helping young recruits travel to Iraq. He was allegedly motivated to do so at the time by the torture pictures coming out of Abu Ghraib prison. Violence does not occur in a vacuum, and people like Kouachi do connect the dots.  &#10;&#10;Mali campaign  &#10;&#10;Since the beginning of its Mali campaign France is now perceived to be at war with Islam. Its alliance with the US against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) last September has prompted the group to encourage its followers to kill what it referred to as the "spiteful and filthy French". This did not fall on deaf ears. Today's attack came after many others that have been recently averted by French security services.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;Young disenfranchised Muslims who choose to resort to violence, not just today's attackers but also the hundreds of recruits who travelled to Syria to join the ranks of ISIL, are not born in a vacuum either. Their perceived sense of structural social humiliation, police profiling, and state harassment, is the fuel to their anger.  &#10;&#10;Given the freedom to access paid employment, enjoy personal fulfilment, and be an equal part of French society, it is undeniable that they would have chosen freedom over violence. Anyone would. They just might not think that this a privilege that they can afford, and this is the failure of not only the French state, but its increasingly Islamophobic population that sees nothing wrong in insulting that religion over others that are considered sacrosanct in French society.  &#10;&#10;While Charlie Hebdo was certainly targeted because of its past publication of Prophet Muhammad caricatures, more importantly, it became the lightning rod for France's disastrous foreign policy choices. Je Suis Charlie.  	'Je Suis Charlie' is a clear reminder that hate will not prevail, and that&#10;freedom of speech is key to French culture.&#10;&#10;

I say disturbingly, because pointing out some common ground may be seen as blurring the crucial distinction between murderous bastards and innocent satirists.  &#10;&#10;Nonetheless, it strikes me as fascinating that the cartoonists were profoundly iconoclastic in their constant ridiculing of religion (all religions, it must be noted) – yet it is precisely this same ancient tradition of iconoclasm that inspires Jews and Muslims to resist representational art and, in its most twisted pathological form, to attack the offices of a Paris magazine and slaughter those whose only weapon was the pen. So what’s the connection?  &#10;&#10;In one sense an iconoclast is someone who refuses the established view of things, who kicks out against cherished beliefs and institutions. Which sounds pretty much like Charlie Hebdo. But the word iconoclast also describes those religious people who refuse and smash representational images, especially of the divine. The second of the Ten Commandments prohibits graven images – which is why there are no pictures of God in Judaism or Islam. And theologically speaking, the reason they are deeply suspicious of divine representation is because they fear that such representations of God might get confused for the real thing. The danger, they believe, is that we might end up overinvesting in a bad copy, something that looks a lot like what we might think of as god, but which, in reality, is just a human projection. So much better then to smash all representations of the divine.  &#10;&#10;And yet this, of course, is exactly what Charlie Hebdo was doing. In the bluntest, rudest, most scatological and offensive of terms, Charlie Hebdo has been insisting that the images people worship are just human creations – bad and dangerous human creations. And in taking the piss out of such images, they actually exist in a tradition of religious iconoclasts going back as far as Abraham taking a hammer to his father’s statues. Both are attacks on representations of the divine. Which is why the terrorists, as well as being murderers, are theologically mistaken in thinking Charlie Hebdo is the enemy. For if God is fundamentally unrepresentable, then any representation of God is necessarily less than God and thus deserves to be fully and fearlessly attacked. And what better way of doing this than through satire, like scribbling a little moustache on a grand statue of God.  &#10;&#10;It’s only some Christians that might demur from this logic. For the Christian story (ie Christmas) tells of God coming into the world as a human being. And in doing this the divine takes on a representational form. Jesus, says St Paul, is the image of the invisible God. Without this the whole western tradition of Catholic religious art and eastern tradition of icons is utterly inconceivable.  &#10;&#10;So I can see how some Christians might find disrespectful images of God a la Charlie Hebdo insulting. After all, they believe it’s possible for images genuinely to capture something of God. But if images can’t capture God – and that’s the Jewish/Islamic position – then bring on the cartoonists. They should be encouraged to do their worst and disrupt our confidence that what we think of as God bears any resemblance to anything legitimately God-like. They are like Moses bringing down the golden calf. It is the ancient job of the iconoclast.  &#10;&#10;But, of course, these terrorists weren’t really interested in theology. They thought that Charlie Hebdo’s cartoonists were insulting their human tribe, a tribe they called fellow Muslims. And maybe they were. But whatever else was happening, it was the atheist cartoonists who were performing the religious function and the apparently believing Muslims who had forgotten their deepest religious insights. For any representation of the divine that leads people to murder each other deserves the maximum possible disrespect.  &#10;&#10;@giles_fraser  	Giles Fraser: Loose canon: Despite being atheists, the Paris satirists are from a long theological tradition of disrespecting religious images

Many might not like the art that prompted the carnage. They may consider it obscene and even an attack on their faith. But in the 21st, 15th or 57th century - whatever your religion, calendar, or country - there is no excuse or justification for responding to art with murder.  &#10;&#10;But there is a clear and frightening explanation for this violence, one that demands not merely outrage at the act itself, but at the system that has made it both predictable and inevitable. The problem is that this system is hundreds of years old, implicates most everyone, and has only become more entrenched in the last several decades as the world has become ever more globalised.  &#10;&#10;Where does the story begin? Quite simply with colonialism. It's no mere coincidence that at least two of the Charlie Hebdo attackers are reportedly of Algerian descent and the third from Senegal. France's 1830 invasion of Algeria began a 130-year odyssey of murder, expropriation, racism, exploitation and misrule that only ended after a vicious anti-colonial struggle costing well over one million Algerian lives.  &#10;&#10;"Colonisation brought the genocide of our identity, of our history, of our language, of our traditions" is how President Abdelaziz Bouteflika well described it. French rule in sub-Saharan West Africa was even more costly, particularly in the context of the centuries-long slave trade.  &#10;&#10;Of course, as in so many newly independent countries, post-independence Algeria and Senegal were ruled by a government that was tied umbilically to the former coloniser and which, however "postcolonial" their official ideology and credentials, became increasing authoritarian and corrupt.  &#10;&#10;In Algeria, the petroleum-rich FLN state - known as "the pouvoir" because of its all-pervasive power - went so far as to launch a brutal internal war that claimed 100,000 lives in the 1990s with the direct support of the West, all to preserve its absolute grip on power. Nigeria, another major oil producer, received similar support for its even more ruinous war against Biafra in the late 1960s. The devastation it caused, including at least one million dead, is one of the rarely discussed causes of the Boko Haram phenomenon.  &#10;&#10;The experiences of Algeria and Senegal are in no way unique. They comprise the story of the modern Muslim world, where with the exception of Turkey, Iran and part of the Arabian peninsula most every society from Morocco to Indonesia fell under generations of European rule in the 19th and 20th centuries. The collective wound of colonialism, its distortion and often destruction of existing pathways to modernity, is for all practical purposes immeasurable. As with a body that takes only seconds to stab or shoot, the deep wounds of foreign domination and postcolonial dictatorship can take a lifetime to heal properly, if ever.  &#10;&#10;Chances of healing  &#10;&#10;Indeed, the chances of healing - of some level of local, democratically accountable control of political and economic development - have become even more remote in the era of neoliberal globalisation, which has been rightly seen by many across the region as essentially colonialism dressed in new clothes (IMF and World Bank policies strongly resemble those of the international banks that brought Tunisia, Egypt and the Ottoman Empire to bankruptcy, and ultimately foreign control, between 1863 and 1875).  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;Radical Islam has today charted a path that mirrors radical capitalism, using violence only shocks "us" because we've managed to make the violence unleashed and supported for so long in our name morally and politically invisible.  &#10;&#10;The major world powers have long coddled favoured local despots of whatever ideological stripe. But the strength of the relationships between western governments and the petroleum-rich states of the Arab world, secured by trillions of dollars cycling back and forth between them through oil and arms sales, finance and heavy industry, is historically unprecedented.  &#10;&#10;Neo-liberalism and jihadism are in fact happy bedfellows (the famous Charlie Hebdo cover of an Islamist and a secular Frenchman kissing would have more accurately depicted a banker, not a hipster.)  &#10;&#10;Both are rapidly anti-democratic, support the concentration of wealth and power, and draw much of their strength from violence, war and a manageable level of chaos that keep oil prices high and petrodollars recycled via everything from fancy weapons to even fancier real estate.  &#10;&#10;French reckoning  &#10;&#10;As one of the world's top arms sellers and home to one of the five "supermajor" oil companies, Total, France has been at the heart of this dynamic. It is not surprising that one of the main long term clients of France has been the Assad family in Syria, whose refusal to honour a shred of the legitimate democratic aspirations of its people produced the horrific civil war whose violence and lawlessness were the perfect petri dish for the growth of al-Qaeda 2.0 (its policies towards Gaddafi's Libya and its former Maghrebi and West African colonies have been no better.)  &#10;&#10;Add to that the ongoing and well-documented structural racism against France's large Arab/Muslim and African communities, which has included mass murder in the streets of Paris and remains "rampant" not merely in the poor suburbs of major cities, where concentrated poverty and marginalisation lead so many to crime, drugs, prison and, not uncommonly, to radicalisation.  &#10;&#10;When newspapers such as the left-leaning Liberation declare that "Europe's leaders are in shock" over the latest attack, their naivety is hard to forgive.  &#10;&#10;Shocking?  &#10;&#10;It's no more shocking that some Muslims have become psychotic enough to murder, rape and pillage their way across eastern Nigeria and eastern Paris than it is that France, home of "liberty", "equality", and "fraternity", sells billions of dollars of weapons and otherwise provides political and diplomatic support to countries that practice the polar opposite of all three; that the US kills thousands of civilians with drones (and tens of thousands with conventional weapons) that are as merciless as the terrorists they presumably target; that Israel kills 1,500 Palestinians with the complete acquiescence of the US and Europe; or that most every Muslim government condemning the attack on Charlie Hebdo routinely imprisons and tortures artists and activists for far less offensive expression, all with the support of the West.  &#10;&#10;As the Lebanese cartoonist Karl Sharro (aka Karl reMarks) points out, ultimately the violence against Charlie Hebdo is not about Islam per se; it's about a contemporary world system that is particularly adept at grinding down whatever decent values exist in Islam and other faith systems (and in liberal capitalism as well). Decades of the combined onslaught of extreme capitalism and extreme religion have shaped a necropolitics of the oppressed that is the mirror image of the necropolitics of local and western governments, and the oppression and violence they've imposed.  &#10;&#10;Former Charlie Hebdo editor Philippe Val, who lost most of his close friends on Wednesday, lamented that "our country will never be the same", and called on France's Muslim community to "be with us" as they confront the scourge of nihilistic terror. But to what France can Muslims truly belong? And which Islam can empower them towards a modernity that provides at least a modicum of "bread, dignity and social justice" - to quote the catch phrase of the now distant Arab Spring.  &#10;&#10;If Charlie Hebdo reminds us of anything it is that the arc of blowback can stretch for decades, growing more uncontrollable as the political, economic, social and technological chaos of the contemporary world increases.  	Charlie Hebdo massacre is rooted in generations of violence, hypocrisy and&#10;greed.&#10;&#10;
044-charliehebdotwilightwestern	aljazeera	Sat, 10 Jan 2015 08:02:45 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/01/charlie-hebdo-twilight-western--201511063740106115.html	Abdullah Al-Arian	Charlie Hebdo and western liberalism	Another horrific tragedy has struck a western capital in the violent murder of French journalists and cartoonists at a satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo. The culprits appear to have done so in response to the magazine's publication of cartoons deemed offensive to Muslims, though they were also thought to have been radicalised by the US-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.  &#10;&#10;French society - and indeed, the global reaction - has been united in its condemnation of the attack and French authorities mobilised the full strength of the state's law enforcement agencies to track down the assailants, who were killed after a standoff with police on Friday.  &#10;&#10;As with most incidents of violence involving Muslims, however, the ensuing public discussion has revolved largely around resolute vows to uphold a fundamental value of western civilisation - the freedom of expression - and degenerated into recriminations about Islam's purported assault on that very freedom. As a result, the natural expressions of grief and sympathy on behalf of the victims have taken on the added quality of high-minded liberal support for the content of the Charlie Hebdo cartoons, irrespective of the publication's history of racism towards Muslims and people of colour.  &#10;&#10;Hegemonic narrative  &#10;&#10;It is only by uncritically adopting the hegemonic narrative of western liberalism that one could reach the conclusion that the biggest threats to freedom of expression in the world today are Islam and North Korea. To frame these events without accounting for the broader context and power relationships at work inhibits any sensible understanding of the deep conflicts plaguing our world at present.  &#10;&#10;By positing western liberal claims to freedom against Islam's supposedly intolerant attitude towards irreverent or serious critiques of it would be to ignore completely the history underlying the current tensions.  &#10;&#10;The reality is that for as long as there have been liberal ideals staking their claim to the various freedoms western societies have come to sacralise, there have also been societies suffering from exploitation and subjugation at the hands of those professing these lofty principles.  &#10;&#10;Even as they were establishing the very foundations of modern liberal societies, from the tenets of freedom of speech and the free exercise of religion to the basis for democratic forms of governance, Enlightenment thinkers were nearly universal in their expression of support for a world built on racial hierarchies and the expansion of new European empires that depended largely on the use of violence to control colonial subjects. That these philosophers developed their racist outlooks towards Jews, Muslims, and blacks on the basis of "reason" and "rationality" makes such views more abhorrent than those derived from pre-modern modes of thought.  &#10;&#10;Whether it is the racist expressions of Enlightenment philosophers or the cartoons of Charlie Hebdo, these provocative views cannot be separated from the broader political projects at work. At the same time that western liberalism gave rise to modern states committed to freedom, democracy, and the rule of law, it also saw to the continuation of slavery, the colonisation and subjugation of large segments of Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas, and global economic exploitation and environmental degradation.  &#10;&#10;Within Europe, western liberal ideals, whose proponents had never concealed their racist and exclusionary outlooks, could not avert the rise of a fascist movement in the mid-20th century that pursued the extermination of millions of people. Even after the devastation of World War II, European appetites for destruction were seemingly unsatiated, as the next two decades were marked by struggles for independence from European powers by colonised peoples in the global south.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;Faced with the prospect of supporting the freedom of the Algerian people, many French liberal intellectuals instead offered enthusiastic support for the brutal suppression of the Algerian struggle in a war that featured the widespread use of torture and the death of over 150,000 Algerians.  &#10;&#10;"They are, all of them, born with raging fanaticism in their hearts, just as the Bretons and the Germans are born with blond hair. I would not be in the least bit surprised if these people would not some day become deadly to the human race."  &#10;&#10;Writing on European Jews, this quote comes not from a propagandist in Nazi Germany, but rather from Voltaire, the 18th century French philosopher whose name has been invoked frequently in recent days as a historic champion of the freedom of expression.  &#10;&#10;Voltaire's views on Islam were no more tempered, as he authored an entire play dedicated to mocking its Prophet Muhammad as "the founder of a false and barbarous sect" and "a sublime and hearty charlatan".  &#10;&#10;While one can defend the right of satirists, government officials, and philosophers to espouse such beliefs - the hashtag #JeSuisCharlie became a popular means of expressing solidarity with the magazine in the hours after the attack - in the face of this history, it should become clear that in the case of cultural production, context always matters. Destructive policies cannot be pursued successfully without the vocabulary and imagery of racism and hatred of the other.  &#10;&#10;One cannot attempt to comprehend the actions of mass murderer Anders Breivik or the recent report on the US government's torture of Muslim prisoners solely against the backdrop of western liberal ideals. However, when one considers the rise of a pervasive Islamophobic atmosphere as seen in prominent discourses across the US and Europe, one can understand the reason such violence becomes possible and, indeed, normalised.  &#10;&#10;The significance of the question of what can be deemed appropriate speech goes far beyond its propensity to offend Muslim minorities, to its potential to have corrosive effects on the broader society. In the same way that western governments take great care to prevent the spread of ideas and messages they consider culpable for radicalising Muslims (all pretensions about freedom of expression be damned), they should consider the role that anti-Muslim cultural production plays in facilitating their own abuses of human rights, and radicalising their own citizens, as seen in the wave of anti-Muslim terrorism that has witnessed a marked rise in the past decade.  &#10;&#10;Commenting on the recent string of Islamophobic statements by Bill Maher and Sam Harris, religion scholar Karen Armstrong noted, "this is the sort of talk that led to the concentration camps". The current permissibility of dehumanising expressions against Muslims has a legacy in the anti-Semitic tropes of a century earlier. Both stem from the same noxious logic of exclusion.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;In fact, western countries have had no qualms about setting aside their liberal values to offer full-fledged support to authoritarian regimes in the Middle East that, incidentally, create the repressive climate that has been proven to give rise to militant extremism. Nor have western societies proved unwilling to abandon claims about support for free speech when the question of social cohesion arises.  &#10;&#10;France banned rallies in solidarity with Gaza during last summer's war and the state has consistently prosecuted writers, comics, and even cartoonists whose work was deemed to risk "disruption to the social order". French Prime Minister Manuel Valls commented on the state's robust record of prosecuting artists saying: "Faced with this creativity of hate, should we do nothing? Certainly not."  &#10;&#10;In 2008, Charlie Hebdo fired an artist and writer for a column that the editors found to be anti-Semitic.  &#10;&#10;At this juncture, western Muslims remain excluded from national dialogues regarding the question of social cohesion. The historical continuity of racial discrimination, coupled with a ramped up pursuit of strategic objectives across a number of Muslim countries during the last two decades have seen to it that an atmosphere of suspicion and hostility has permeated the public sphere in the US and revived the legacy of intolerance in Europe.  &#10;&#10;To understand and counteract the violent behaviour of extremists, these tragic events should be examined in light of this context, rather than through the lens of free speech. From Voltaire and the Enlightenment to the present, modern western discourses are replete with critiques of Islam.  &#10;&#10;By contrast, the abhorrent violence by some Muslims is a recent phenomenon, and one that must be confronted by addressing the failure of western liberalism to live up to its stated ideals, not by reflexively continuing to sing its praises.  	Islam has been unfairly criticised and ridiculed in the west for centuries.&#10;&#10;
045-charliehebdousthem	aljazeera	Sun, 11 Jan 2015 01:35:24 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/01/charlie-hebdo-us-them-201511152114498897.html	Rachel Shabi	Charlie Hebdo: 'Us or them'	In the face of terrible deaths, at a time when we are so destructively polarised, this must be said bold and up front and repeatedly: No cartoonist deserves to be killed, ever. No innocent person shopping for kosher food deserves to be terrorised and murdered, either. All of those tragic deaths in France last week, including those of a policeman and policewoman, and numbering 17 in total, all of them are horrendous and incomprehensible.  &#10;&#10;In the face of this terrible killing spree in France, at the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and then at a kosher supermarket, the overwhelming reaction is revulsion. But at the same time, there's a need to respond in other ways as well, to frame a discussion that can prevent this tragedy leading to even more tragedies, or being spun out to lash out at other innocent people. And here is the trouble with the backlash that has already begun, and the demands that have being made in the name of "solidarity".  &#10;&#10;France today stages a unity march, an attempt to help heal a wounded nation, amidst a much wider discussion of the need to stand together in the face of terror.  &#10;&#10;But within that discussion, there has been a distinct fundamentalism - for example, in the insistence that to support Charlie Hedbo's right to publish, we must reprint and replicate their work.  &#10;&#10;It's an unnecessary conflation of two things: support for the right to do something and actually doing the thing. It should, of course, be possible to express disgust at the murders fully, without having to endorse certain types of offensiveness.  &#10;&#10;And the French magazine, while broad-spectrum in its religious targets, has undeniably focused its gaze on France's Muslim minority in a racist manner, in recent years.  &#10;&#10;There is, for media, a responsibility (the abrogation of which clearly does not invite murder) to not be tone deaf about the environments we live in: about ignored hierarchies of control; about powerless minorities and colonial heritage and migration and foreign policy; about how things feel when you are stigmatised, marginalised and scapegoated; about what it's like when you don't have a voice or much representation in the mainstream; and when the majority culture insists that equality and liberty await all those who just learn to be more like the majority.  &#10;&#10;If we don't create the space to say these things without casting those that do so as fanatical supporters of murder, then what is this limitless freedom of expression we keep insisting we are firmly on the side of?  &#10;&#10;The demand that we all respond in a mass, uniform way also makes a basic error about how unity works - which is to forget that it can only survive if there are spaces between us; solidarity and common ground take hold because of the existence of a spectrum in thought and experience, and not despite these things.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;Deadly terrorism seeks to stamp out the possibility of difference - which is why, in condemning outright those atrocities in France, we need also to keep insisting on and cherishing our diversity.  &#10;&#10;Meanwhile, equally fundamentalist is the predictable casting of blame at Muslims and their "backward" culture, painting this as a "clash of civilisations" and insisting that all Muslims repeatedly apologise for the slaughters in France. The now routine insistence that all Muslims apologise for all such atrocities has spawned a spoof Muslim iCondemn phone app for such eventualities - a curious development, since we have been led to believe that Muslims don't actually have a sense of humour.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;'Civilised v barbarian'  &#10;&#10;The ridiculous "civilised v barbarian" argument has been skilfully taken apart by others - its false premises, hypocrisy and misguided superiority complex rigorously deconstructed.  &#10;&#10;But there's grave danger in this sort of "us or them" thinking - not just in the physical attacks on mosques and Muslims in France, which have already begun and which are obviously bad enough.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;The danger in blaming Muslims for such atrocities is that we shirk any responsibility. And the harsh reality is that the French killings, just like previous terror atrocities in Britain, just like the European self-proclaimed jihadists that go and fight for the death cult Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), are all homegrown.  &#10;&#10;We - not just Muslim society, but our societies - are accountable. We, not just the fanatics that recruit to and commit mindless terror, are bound up in the causes and the context in a way that makes it not just insulting but actively counterproductive to single out Muslims as bearing sole responsibility both for the crimes and for their prevention.  &#10;&#10;If we don't own this terrible reality collectively, we won't be able to find a way out of it collectively, either - and that means we won't be able to find a way out of it at all.  	The danger in blaming Muslims for the Charlie Hebdo massacre and other&#10;atrocities is that we shirk any responsibility.&#10;&#10;
046-chedevansdebategordontaylorvic	guardian	2015-01-09T21:17:22Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/09/ched-evans-debate-gordon-taylor-victim-blamers-victim-blamer	Marina Hyde	Just when the Ched Evans debate couldn’t get any lower, up pops Gordon Taylor OBE	No matter how much anyone prayed that the Ched Evans “debate” had completed its race to the bottom this week, it was never going to have done so until we’d heard in full from Gordon Taylor. That pleasure was always in the post, and yesterday the PFA chief delivered, with what we might painfully cast as football’s version of Godwin’s law: a comparison with Hillsborough. “He wouldn’t be the first person to be found guilty, maintained his innocence, and been proved right,” Taylor opined to the BBC. “We know what happened with Hillsborough.”  &#10;&#10;Oh, man … Gordon Taylor. Or rather, GORDON TAYLOR OBE, as his name appeared in my inbox when he emailed me once. Sensationally dim, wantonly self-interested, wildly over-remunerated and frequently morally compromised, Gordon functions as an auto-satire on all the worst things people think about football.  &#10;&#10;Reputed to be the highest paid union official in the world, and one who has been in his job for just the 33 years, Taylor has now said he didn’t mean “to upset anybody”, though I need hardly add that he has no plans to consider his position after his latest display of incompetence.  &#10;&#10;In which case, I hope he’ll forgive my considering it for him – an act that has become as essential an annual event for me as putting up the Christmas tree or rewatching the early work of Steven Seagal. Unless Taylor’s presence is dramatically revealed as the second-highest-profile instance of affirmative action for idiots in public life – the first being Iain Duncan Smith’s position in government – then it hardly needs pointing out again that Gordon is no longer fit for purpose, if indeed he ever was. But more on his record shortly.  &#10;&#10;That Taylor should have rifled through his Rolodex of metaphors and alighted on the absolute archetype of victim-blaming in order to continue obliquely victim-blaming in the Ched Evans case … well, perhaps there’s a mirthless laugh to be had there. But it would take a stronger stomach than mine to manage it.  &#10;&#10;The sadness – or rather, one of many acute and diverse sadnesses – is that this was a week in which football was crying out for an intelligent and sensitive advocate, finding itself once more cast in a role it should never be required to occupy in a truly civilised society.  &#10;&#10;All manner of people appeared convinced that the game should mitigate the deficiencies of the criminal justice system, just as a worrying number were keen to say Evans was absolutely welcome to work again – flipping burgers or sweeping the streets.  &#10;&#10;These are the jobs that are fit for rapists, we must infer, which must feel hugely complimentary to those non-rapists who are putting in shifts doing the same for minimal pay right now. Meanwhile, as the Mail’s Martin Samuel pointed out, footballers – footballers! – “are placed in the same bracket as doctors, teachers or legal professionals”. If that seems to you like a view of society worth shoring up, the week will have felt distinctly encouraging.  &#10;&#10;As for football fans – the great “them” of many debates – they have spent the week being cast as too thick and impressionable to be able to make their own judgments about a convicted rapist. Evans could have been nothing but a role model, presumably to the vast tumult who turn out at Boundary Park each week (4,415 on average last season).  &#10;&#10;It’s as depressing as it is disturbing. Such toxicity and lunacy have attached themselves to football and its place in our society that those who love the sport as well as those who play it really need the calm, cool intellect and charm of a Shami Chakrabarti to lobby in their real interests and those of the game.  &#10;&#10;Instead, they have Gordon Taylor, whose focus was memorably dismissed by Peter Schmeichel during one stage of the Paul Gascoigne saga. “Instead of getting great deals on cars and other luxury goods for members,” the former Manchester United and Denmark goalkeeper fumed, “PFA should commit more time and funds to help the like of Gazza.”  &#10;&#10;Taylor was stung – into self-defence, of course. “Peter doesn’t know what we’ve done for Paul,” he announced to the Press Association, “a lot of which has to be confidential.”  &#10;&#10;It certainly does. Except Gordon just couldn’t bring himself to keep it that way. The next few days were spent with this union leader giving detailed interviews on Gascoigne’s mental state and past treatment, in which he divulged telephone calls with the player, made off-the-cuff pseudo-clinical diagnoses, and – unbelievably – used the union’s own website to warn: “If we’re not careful, it is going to be akin to George Best.” Then again, Taylor had form with sharing details of members’ treatment, having done the same with Joey Barton only a few months previously.  &#10;&#10;Anyway, on we go. In 2013 came the revelation that Taylor had amassed a £100,000 debt to a bookmaker – almost an inevitability to those who recalled him pontificating about a “zero tolerance” approach to betting among players just a couple of years before.  &#10;&#10;And no round-up of Gordon’s greatest hits would be complete without a look at that endlessly intriguing confidentiality deal he signed with News International, which awarded him a £700,000 settlement for phone-hacking in return for his silence. As the News of the World’s lawyers later had it in a letter to the Commons culture, media and sport committee, Taylor’s lawyers had informed them that he “wanted to be vindicated or made rich”.  &#10;&#10;Given that he reportedly earns £984,000 a year (maybe more these days), you might judge him to be rich already – but of course, we know which option won out, a deal that precluded Taylor from breathing a word about phone-hacking to any of his union’s members, who he might reasonably have concluded could have been victims themselves. As they were eventually proved (by others) to have been.  &#10;&#10;So there you have him: the pastoral carer who reveals details of his members’ mental health in the noble cause of self-defence. The gambler who wishes to outlaw gamblers. The ur-phone-hacking plaintiff who agreed to take the £700,000 and say absolutely nothing about the matter, despite being responsible for players who of course turned out to have been targeted too. And now he is the victim-blamer’s victim-blamer, in a week where, you might have hazarded, even Katie Hopkins couldn’t have contrived to make a grim situation worse.  &#10;&#10;Still, experience would indicate that Taylor ignores his detractors at the very opposite of his peril. So all that remains is for me to take the early opportunity to apologise for next year’s inevitable appearance of this column, and bid Mr Taylor a cordial au revoir.  	Marina Hyde: With his crude comparison to Hillsborough, the PFA boss can add the title of victim-blamer’s victim-blamer to all his other accolades

The strength, courage and determination that often comes from adversity. The daylight following the darkness.  &#10;&#10;After the bloodshed and incessant school attacks of 2014, let 2015 be a year of hope, of action and the fulfilment of a promise made 15 years ago to boys and girls across the world. They are waiting and watching.  &#10;&#10;The famous novelist JK Rowling, leader of a charity helping 25 million orphans, recently asked; "Who is easier to silence than a child?"  &#10;&#10;Because children have no votes and traditionally little voice, the expectation is that they will not protest. But be certain about this - young people whose rights have been violated will be silent no more.  &#10;&#10;I know this is true because in the space of a few hours last month I watched in awe as tens, then hundreds, then thousands, then hundreds of thousands showed their outrage and their unity following an attack on a school in Pakistan in which 132 children were massacred.  &#10;&#10;A petition launched in the aftermath of the attack, to honour those killed and demanding education for all, is now 1.5 million names strong and is still growing as each precious minute passes. One voice.  &#10;&#10;In the future, people will look back on this generation and they will say an historic civil rights struggle for the rights of young people was born.  &#10;&#10;This, I believe, must be a time of hope. People need hope. Hope is that small voice that says we will not be silenced if we have strong beliefs we want to follow.  &#10;&#10;We must never stop believing that the cause we are talking about can be won in our generation.  &#10;&#10;And remember, we do not break promises to children.  &#10;&#10;We crossed our hearts. The United Nations told the world that every boy and every girl, everywhere, would have access to a school and to an education and to opportunity.  &#10;&#10;Its official name is Millennium Development Goal 2 and the official target is universal primary education. Unofficially, it's the only chance of a life for millions and millions of children. Now, as the clock ticks down towards zero hour we are trying but toiling to make it happen. But we can change it. There is time.  &#10;&#10;There are seven other MDGs, all vital but none as critical to our children's future. With just 11 months and 20 days to go, there are still 58 million boys and girls who will be failed by a broken promise and never even have a day's learning. There are hundreds of millions more who will not finish their education.  &#10;&#10;Less than a month ago two champions of global education and girls' rights shared a platform in Oslo, Norway. Malala Yousafzai and Kailash Satyarthi stood in front of the world, proud and deserving joint winners of the Nobel Peace Prize.  &#10;&#10;Their brave words and actions rightly rewarded, then so many of their hopes for the future crushed when six days later came the worst school atrocity of all time. 132 boys and girls slaughtered by Taliban gunmen in Peshawar.  &#10;&#10;On the same day 15 children were bombed to death by terrorists attacking a school bus in Yemen. The next day dozens of school pupils were killed and 100 abducted in a repeat of the Boko Haram attack almost nine months ago when 200 schoolgirls in Nigeria were abducted, yet to return home.  &#10;&#10;Last year was like no other in which vulnerable youngsters - whose right to be shielded from war is supposedly guaranteed in successive United Nations charters and resolutions - were systematically violated, exploited, injured, raped and killed.  &#10;&#10;The bombing of schools in Syria was followed by the militarisation of schools in Gaza and then by verified reports of child atrocities and rape in Iraq.  &#10;&#10;According to The Yazidi Fraternal Organization (YFO), thousands of young Yazidi women and children are being used by ISIL as sex slaves. And there are now an estimated 250,000 child soldiers conscripted into militias round the world; 100,000 of them girls.  &#10;&#10;From Syria and Iraq to South Sudan and the Central African Republic we have seen more children uprooted and displaced than at any time since the Second World War.  &#10;&#10;The number of child refugees has risen by nearly two million in just one year to a staggering 25 million - the population of a medium-sized country. And now the seemingly endless violation of children's rights is being eclipsed again and again by the growing use of schools as theatres of war.  &#10;&#10;Twenty five years ago, the world signed up to the Convention for the Rights of the Child. 2014 will be remembered as the year of the violation of the rights of the child. We have 11 months left to ensure 2015 is about the delivery of the rights of the child.  &#10;&#10;Youth organisations such as Global March Against Child Labour, Girls Not Brides and A World at School, which now sponsors nearly 1,000 youth ambassadors, are becoming global leaders of a youth liberation struggle. They are fighting child marriage, child labour, child trafficking and discrimination against girlsand the principal way to end exploitation is to deliver free compulsory education.  &#10;&#10;One of the #UpForSchool petition signatories was Malala Yousafzai, herself the victim of a Taliban gunman. She will tell us there is still hope. People are angry about what is happening to children. Even angrier still are young people themselves. Do not underestimate them. They are connected, they talk to each other and they understand each other. They are as one and they are seething.  &#10;&#10;Recently, in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, I stood with 1,000 young people as they bowed their heads for victims of the Pakistan school attack. They all signed the petition. The same happened a few days earlier when thousands of young people demonstrated in Kenya and at the Nobel ceremony in Oslo more than 6,000 children gathered to show unity for girls' rights and for education.  &#10;&#10;For too long young people have relied on adults who have done too little to stop the violation of the rights of the children for whom they were responsible.  &#10;&#10;In 2015 it will be a civil rights struggle of young people LED by young people that will be the world's best hope.  	The endless violation of children's rights is eclipsed by the growing use of&#10;schools as theatres of war.&#10;&#10;
048-childrentownsandcitiesrobbedsp	guardian	2015-01-06T18:58:06Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/06/children-towns-and-cities-robbed-spaces-play	George Monbiot	Children in our towns and cities are being robbed of safe spaces to play	Where do the children play? Where can they run around unsupervised? On most of the housing estates I visit, the answer is hardly anywhere.  &#10;&#10;A community not built around children is no community at all. A place that functions socially is one in which they are drawn to play outdoors.  &#10;&#10;As Jay Griffiths argues in her heartrending book Kith, children fill the “unoccupied territories”, the spaces not controlled by tidy-minded adults, “the commons of mud, moss, roots and grass”. But such places are being purged from the land and their lives.  &#10;&#10;“Today’s children are enclosed in school and home, enclosed in cars to shuttle between them, enclosed by fear, by surveillance and poverty and enclosed in rigid schedules of time.” Since the 1970s the area in which children roam without adults has decreased by almost 90%. “Childhood is losing its commons.”  &#10;&#10;Given all that we know about the physical and psychological impacts of this confinement, you would expect the authorities to ensure that the remaining 10% of their diminished range is designed to draw children out of their homes. Yet almost everywhere they are designed out. Housing estates are built on the playing fields and rough patches children used to inhabit, and offer almost nothing in return.  &#10;&#10;In the government’s masterplan for England, the national planning policy framework, children are mentioned only twice: in a catalogue of housing types. In parliament’s review of these plans, they aren’t mentioned at all. Young people, around whom our lives should revolve, have been airbrushed from the planning system.  &#10;&#10;I spent Monday wandering around the new and newish housing developments on the east side of Northampton. I chose this area because the estates here are spacious and mostly built for families: in other words, there is no possible excuse for excluding young people.  &#10;&#10;In the places built 10 or 20 years ago, there is plenty of shared space, but almost all of it is allocated to cars. (You can see the photos on my website.) Grass is confined to the roundabouts or to coffin-like gardens, in which you can’t turn a cartwheel without hitting the fence. I came across one exception – a street with wide grass verges. But they sloped towards the road: dangerous and useless, a perfect waste of space.  &#10;&#10;This land of missed opportunities, designed by people without a spark of joy in their hearts, reifies the idea that there is no such thing as society. Had you set out to ensure that children were neither seen nor heard, you could not have done a better job. On the last day of the holidays, which was warm and dry, across four estates I saw only one child.  &#10;&#10;By comparison, the Cherry Orchard estate just completed by Bellway Homes is a children’s paradise. But only by comparison. Next to the primary school, with plenty of three- and four-bedroom houses, it is designed to appeal to young families. But in the middle of the development, where a village green might have been, there’s a strange grassy sump, surrounded by a low fence. It’s an empty balancing pond, to catch water during exceptional floods. Remove the fence, plant it with trees, throw in some rocks and logs, and you’d have a rough and mossy playground. But no such thing was in the plans.  &#10;&#10;Other shared spaces on the estate have the charming ambience of a prison yard: paved and surrounded by garden fences almost nine feet high. There were a few children outdoors but they seemed pressed to the edges, sitting in doorways or leaning on fences. Children don’t buy houses, so who cares?  &#10;&#10;Throughout the country, they become prisoners of bad design, and so do adults. Without safe and engaging places in which they can come together, no tribe forms. So parents must play the games that children would otherwise play among themselves, and everyone is bored to tears.  &#10;&#10;The exclusion of children arises from the same pathology that denies us decent housing. In the name of market freedom, the volume housebuilders, sitting on their land banks, are free to preside over speculative chaos, while we are free to buy dog kennels priced like palaces in placeless estates so badly designed that community is dead on arrival. Many want to design and build their own homes, but almost no plots are available, as the big builders have seized them.  &#10;&#10;In Scotland the government is considering compulsory sale orders, which would pull down prices – essential when the speculative price of land has risen from 2% of the cost of a home in the 1930s to 70% today. A national housing land corporation would assemble the sites and supply the infrastructure, then sell plots to community groups, housing associations and people who want to build their own.  &#10;&#10;It goes far beyond England’s feeble community right-to-build measures, which lack the muscular facilitation that only public authorities can provide. But it’s still not far enough.  &#10;&#10;What if people were entitled to buy an option for a plot on a new estate, which they would then help to plan? Not just the houses, but the entire estate would be built for and by those who would live there. The council or land corporation would specify the number and type of homes, then the future residents – including people on the social housing waiting list – would design the layout. Their children would help to create the public spaces. Communities would start to form even before people moved in, and the estates would doubtless look nothing like those built today.  &#10;&#10;To the Westminster government, this probably sounds like communism. But as countries elsewhere in Europe have found, we don’t need volume house builders, except to construct high-rises. They do not assist the provision of decent, affordable homes. They impede it. What is good for them is bad for us.  &#10;&#10;Bellway, its brochure reveals, asked children at the neighbouring primary school to paint a picture of a cherry orchard, and displayed the winning entries in its show home. “Why not pop over to say hello, view our wonderful development and sneak a peek?”, it asks. That’s the role the children were given: helping the company to sell the houses it had already built.  &#10;&#10;Why can’t we shape the places that shape our lives?

(AP Photo/Cliff Owen)  &#10;&#10;When I moved from Florida to New Jersey this past year, I never thought that I would discover what I have. Growing up, all I knew was that I was Methodist. My family attended Methodist churches, and no one ever mentioned that my mom had a Jewish background. This year has been about discovering what I never knew, and learning the beauty of Judaism through a Christian lens.  &#10;&#10;One day last Spring I decided to go to a garage sale in the Orthodox Jewish community near my home. While there, I mentioned that I was curious to learn more about Judaism. The woman in charge listened to my story, and concluded with delight, “If your mother was Jewish, and your grandmother was Jewish, then YOU are Jewish.”  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;My head started spinning.  &#10;&#10;I’m Jewish? Wait. No. I’m Methodist. Now I am no religious scholar, but aren’t there large differences between Christianity and Judaism?  &#10;&#10;The answer is yes.  &#10;&#10;From that moment I began to sort through my own faith. There are so many beautiful qualities about Judaism. Many know that they set aside an entire day each week-Saturday, the seventh day- to pray and honor God as the creator. They call it Shabbos- the Sabbath. I can’t remember the last time I devoted more than 20 minutes to this thought.  &#10;&#10;Don’t get me wrong, I am extremely thankful to God for creating the universe and for giving me life. But like most people, I have things to do on the weekend that I can’t accomplish on Sunday alone. I can’t spend an entire day dedicated to prayer and rest, but the Orthodox community does — and it is one of the most interesting and beautiful rituals I’ve ever seen.  &#10;&#10;I’ve come to realize that the Jewish community is filled with wonderful people. Because of my Jewish roots, several families have taken an interest in me, “adopting” me into their families and invited me into their homes. I’ve begun studying the Torah once a week and learning about how Jews practice their religion, both in synagogue and at home.  &#10;&#10;When learning about these practices, I become confused- not as to why Orthodox Jews do those things, but because it sounds so biblically logical why they do it. I question why I haven’t devoted one day out of the week to honoring God.  &#10;&#10;Hanukkah begins Tuesday night, and I will be celebrating it for the first time. I am both excited and nervous, because now that I know I’m Jewish by blood, celebrating Hanukkah seems important. I’m honored really to be able to learn from a firsthand view instead of from a book.  &#10;&#10;My journey isn’t over yet. It will probably continue for years to come. One of the things that make my faith exploration limitless is that my parents are no longer living. I have no encouragement or discouragement in my life from my parents; my life’s direction completely up to me. It’s my job, then, to listen to God’s word, and His convictions in my life.  &#10;&#10;I have no real goal here and sometimes I wonder if I should. I don’t know where this is going, but that is a beautiful thing. I’ve always wanted to take a trip and have no destination. How thrilling and nerve wracking.  &#10;&#10;What I do know, is this is my journey through Judaism.  &#10;&#10;As soon as I find out where it leads, you will know.

But on Jan. 6 – the day he was supposed to return to work – he was fired.  &#10;&#10;The mayor denied that Cochran’s faith had anything to do with his dismissal. Instead, he said it was lack of judgment and management skills. He also said Cochran violated the city’s code of conduct.  &#10;&#10;Folks, this was nothing short of an old-fashioned witch hunt led by the mayor, LGBT activists and the city’s left-wing firefighter’s union.  &#10;&#10;According to the city’s investigation, they interviewed a retired lesbian battalion chief who harbored “suspicions” about Cochran’s Christian faith.  &#10;&#10;“She stated that she took a voluntary demotion because of these suspicions,” the report states.  &#10;&#10;What a load of fertilizer.  &#10;&#10;The Atlanta Professional Firefighters Local 134 piled on, commending the mayor for firing the Christian fire chief.  &#10;&#10;“Local 134 supports LGBT rights and equality among all employees,” the union said in a statement, urging the city to “improve LGBT rights by adding an LGBT liaison for the fire department.”  &#10;&#10;Now, the leadership of Local 134 is either ignorant or illiterate – because the official investigation clearly shows the fire chief NEVER DISCRIMINATED AGAINST LGBT FIREFIGHTERS.  &#10;&#10;The New York Times editorial board said it doesn’t matter if Chief Cochran was innocent. That’s not the point, it wrote Tuesday in a scathing editorial titled “God, Gays and the Atlanta Fire Department.”  &#10;&#10;“It should not matter that the investigation found no evidence that Mr. Cochran had mistreated gays or lesbians,” the Times wrote. “His position as a high-level public servant makes his remarks especially problematic, and requires that he be held to a different standard.”  &#10;&#10;The mayor may have the LGBT activists, the union and The New York Times on his side – but Chief Cochran has some much bigger firepower – the nation’s evangelical community.  &#10;&#10;Leading the charge is Franklin Graham, president of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. Graham told me he’s known Cochran for years – and found him to be a decent and honorable man.  &#10;&#10;He said Cochran has become the latest victim of a national cleansing of Christians in the public marketplace.  &#10;&#10;“We need to stand up with Chief Cochran and others when they are persecuted,” Graham told me. “This man is being persecuted because he believes the Bible.”  &#10;&#10;Robert White, executive director of the Georgia Baptist Convention, called The New York Times editorial “quite remarkable.”  &#10;&#10;“It declares his innocence and then declares him guilty,” he said. “Guilty of what? He didn’t discriminate against any homosexuals. He vowed that he wanted to have a healthy workplace for all of his employees.”  &#10;&#10;The Times went on to argue that while Cochran is free to believe whatever he wants, there are limits to where he can believe and still maintain gainful employment in the public arena.  &#10;&#10;If I didn’t know better, I’d say The New York Times is suggesting a “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy for public workers who happen to be Christian.  	Former Atlanta Fire Chief Kelvin Cochran says he was fired because he wrote a&#10;book expressing his Christian faith, according to a discrimination complaint&#10;filed Jan. 19 with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.&#10;&#10;

He is also a devout Christian. He’s a deacon at a Baptist church and also teaches Sunday school. By all accounts – he is a decent and honorable man. And now – he is unemployed.  &#10;&#10;Cochran, who served seven years as the chief of the Atlanta Fire Departmant lost his job over a book he wrote about biblical morality titled, “Who Told You That You Were Naked?” A small portion of the book contained what critics called homophobic language.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed suspended Cochran last month. He was fired on Jan. 6 – the day he was supposed to return to work.  &#10;&#10;“I profoundly disagree with and am deeply disturbed by the sentiments expressed in the paperback regarding the LGBT community,” Reed wrote last November on his official Facebook page. “I will not tolerate discrimination of any kind within my administration.”  &#10;&#10;Reed told reporters Cochran was not fired because of his religious beliefs. Rather, he said, the fire chief was ousted because of poor judgment. The mayor accused the chief of not getting permission to write the book – a charge Cochran denies.  &#10;&#10;The mayor also alleged Cochran distributed the book to members of the fire department. Cochran readily admits that he gave copies of the book to close associates within the department. It should be noted that the individual who initially complained about the book did not receive a copy from the fire chief.  &#10;&#10;And for the record – a city investigation determined the fire chief had not discriminated against LGBT employees.  &#10;&#10;But The New York Times editorial board said it doesn’t matter if Chief Cochran was innocent. That’s not the point, they wrote Tuesday in a scathing editorial titled, “God, Gays and the Atlanta Fire Department.”  &#10;&#10;“It should not matter that the investigation found no evidence that Mr. Cochran had mistreated gays or lesbians,” the Times wrote. “His position as a high-level public servant makes his remarks especially problematic, and requires that he be held to a different standard.”  &#10;&#10;Robert White, executive director of the Georgia Baptist Convention, called The New York Times editorial “quite remarkable.”  &#10;&#10;“It declares his innocence and then declares him guilty,” he said. “Guilty of what?

Among those taking up his cause are the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, the Georgia Baptist Convention and the Family Research Council.  &#10;&#10;Click here to follow Todd on Facebook!  &#10;&#10;“What happened to Chief Cochran goes to the core of religious freedom,” he said. “Georgia Baptists are deeply concerned about the mistreatment of Kelvin Cochran.”  &#10;&#10;Franklin Graham said Cochran was a target of “politically correct bullying against Bible-believing Christians” and vowed to stand alongside the embattled former fire chief.  &#10;&#10;Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, said the Times had “reached a new low in blatant hypocrisy.”  &#10;&#10;“The New York Times is calling for public servants to be held to a different standard when it comes to their freedom of speech and religion,” Perkins said. “I think most Americans are quite happy with the standard that we have had for the last 226 years – the First Amendment.”  &#10;&#10;If nothing else, Cochran’s public shaming at the hands of Atlanta’s mayor has unified Georgia Christians from all denominations and races.  &#10;&#10;“This is one of those things that can bring people together from all of the political spectrum,” Garland Hunt, chairman of the Network of Politically Active Christians, told me. “This is about religious freedom. This is not about whether a person is conservative or liberal.”  &#10;&#10;The reality is that a good man – a husband and father and grandfather - was fired from his job because his boss objected to his religious beliefs. That just ought not to happen in the United States.  &#10;&#10;I’m reminded of something Chief Cochran told me.  &#10;&#10;“The LGBT members of our community have a right to be able to express their views and convictions about sexuality and deserve to be respected for their position without hate or discrimination,” he said. “But Christians also have a right to express our belief regarding our faith and be respected for our position without hate and without discrimination. In the United States, no one should be vilified, hated or discriminated against for expressing their beliefs.”  &#10;&#10;Maybe those who preach tolerance and diversity might want to consider practicing it, too.

(AP Photo/Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Bob Andres)  &#10;&#10;Mary, the mother of Jesus, features prominently in our Christmas celebrations. Christmas carols, greeting cards and nativity reenactments all celebrate the important role she played in the birth of the Messiah. But what about Joseph? What does the Christmas story say about the role of fathers? The Gospel of Matthew, written in the second half of the first century to a predominantly Jewish audience, places Joseph at the center of the birth of Christ. Complimentary to the Gospel of Luke where most of the activity centers on Mary, Matthew reports that it is Joseph that is instructed by an angel in a dream not to call off his impending marriage to Mary. Joseph is pictured as a decisive leader, protector and provider for his family in this Gospel. The birth narratives of Jesus in Matthew, not only highlights the importance of family as the building block of a stable society, but also communicates the importance of fathers in the raising of children. With Joseph as our example, four lessons for fathers can be taken from this Christmas story.  &#10;&#10;First, to be a father is not just a biological description. Joseph was not the physical father of Jesus, but as instructed by the angel took Mary as his wife and provided a home for Jesus. Being a father is a matter of the heart. Joseph is a great role model for those fathers that have chosen to raise non- biological children as their own. Fathers create homes for children by enlarging their hearts and providing a safe and nurturing environment for them. Second, fathers model good values to their children. Matthew calls Joseph a just man. This is in sharp contrast to the wicked Herod in the same Gospel, who kills numerous boys in his narcissistic rage as he attempts to remove the pending threat of the birth of the King of the Jews. We are inundated with so many painful recollections of fathers that did not match the expectations of their children.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Good fathers embody the moral and hopeful ideals of their children. They model the way. Third, fathers do all in their power to protect their family. Joseph, warned in a dream about the murderous plans of Herod, moves his family to the safety of Egypt. This selfless act of Joseph illustrates what good fathers do best – they place the interest of their families above their own. Lastly, fathers provide a future for their children. Once again, Matthew records that Joseph in returning from Egypt scanned the environment and decided to move Jesus and Mary to Galilee, far from the watchful eye of Archelaus, the ruler that succeeded Herod. Good fathers recognize that fathering does not end when children turn of age. Fathers consider the future of their children beyond their own mortality and work to provide a prosperous and successful future for them. Perhaps the time has come to reconsider the role of Joseph in our celebration of Christmas. May we rediscover not only his good example, but the stabilizing and transformative effect that good fathers have on children, families and societies.  	Mary, the mother of Jesus, features prominently in our Christmas celebrations.&#10;Christmas carols, greeting cards and nativity reenactments all celebrate the&#10;important role she played in the birth of the Messiah.

053-christmasnewyearsdreadholidays	foxnews	2014-12-23T21:01:00Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/12/23/christmas-new-years-dread-holidays-or-shape-them-to-be-life-giving/	Robert V. Taylor	Christmas, New Year's: Dread the holidays or shape them to be life-giving	FILE -- Dec. 17, 2014: A visitor to the Free Library of Philadelphia walks through the lobby by a Christmas tree in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)  &#10;&#10;You can dread the holidays as a passive bystander or you can actively shape your experience of them to be life-giving. Your choice will reaffirm whether you choose to be fully alive in the present or not.  &#10;&#10;All too often I hear people express angst about holiday gatherings that they feel obligated to attend. To be certain there are gatherings such as work related events where your absence would not serve you well.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Those who anticipate the holidays share a sense of gladness and expectation about being with at least some of the guests. Their anticipation is usually grounded in a well-developed self-awareness which accepts others as they are and an ability to not get caught up in the drama or baggage of others.  &#10;&#10;These three tools to create a life-giving experience of the holiday season can also be applied to other work or family events.  &#10;&#10;1\. Detach to Engage. You are not obligated to engage in or endure lengthy and painful conversations with those whose energy, attitude or chip on their shoulder sucks the spirit out of you or others. Those are their issues and choices, not yours. You are not responsible for their behavior and you cannot change it.  &#10;&#10;You can be polite and detach. Detachment is the practice that reflects your grounding as a compassionate and courageous person. With loving intention you entrust the well-being of the person you detach from to the goodness of the Universe. This is not an expression of anger or righteousness but an act of hoping for their highest good.  &#10;&#10;It frees you both. Your detachment allows you to be fully present to the positive energy of other guests.  &#10;&#10;2\. Frame New Conversations. One woman found herself filled with anxiety at the thought of family holiday events. She dreaded the sexist, racist and homophobic jokes or comments that would be offered. She thought about abandoning her family’s events. Instead she decided that she did not want to walk away as a helpless victim.  &#10;&#10;She prepared herself with stories to tell in response to the inevitable offensive comments. When she told those stories – attending the wedding of two women at her church, getting to know Latino immigrants through her volunteer work – she discovered that the landscape changed. Her stories invited connection to real human beings beyond labels and crude jokes. Her experience of the family gatherings began to shift.  &#10;&#10;3\. Name Your Gratitude. Your gratitude is a reflection of the rich variety of relationships and experiences that shape your life. It can only be compromised by the negative or toxic behavior of others if you allow them to elbow your gratitude to the sidelines.  &#10;&#10;In preparation for the center of the holiday season take a few minutes each day to name or write down one person or experience you are grateful for. This practice creates a heartfelt mosaic of gratefulness.  &#10;&#10;Express your thankfulness to each of the people you have named and the particular experiences they may have shaped. If you will not see them in person express your gratitude via a note, email or social media tool.  &#10;&#10;If you are with the person be prepared for how you will convey your heartfelt thanks. Naming your gratitude creates a mindful way of appreciating your interconnection with others.  &#10;&#10;When you detach in order to engage, frame new conversations and name your gratitude you choose to be present to yourself and others in life-affirming ways. These choices unclutter the angst or apprehension you might feel. They allow you to experience holiday gatherings in unexpected and positive ways.  &#10;&#10;How will you be proactive in your choices?  	You can dread the holidays as a passive bystander or you can actively shape&#10;your experience of them to be life-giving. Your choice will reaffirm whether&#10;you choose to be fully alive in the present or not.&#10;&#10;

McFarland	CIA interrogation report: Democrats want to punish America, blame Bush	  &#10;&#10;In its ideological zeal to punish America, the outgoing Democratically- controlled Senate, plans to make public a report that, according to Fox News will examine “the alleged use of torture by the CIA.”  &#10;&#10;Although the 6,000 page full report will remain classified, the 500 page summary is expected to be released to the public in coming days. According to press reports from those who are familiar with the study, it is expected to portray the American intelligence community in the worst possible light. The report’s release and details about CIA interrogations that took place a decade ago will endanger Americans abroad today, destroy essential relationships with foreign intelligence communities going forward, and cripple American human intelligence gathering networks for a generation.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Put bluntly, Democrats in the Senate are behaving like tenants who got evicted and decide to trash the house on their way out the door.  &#10;&#10;There is nothing to be gained by releasing the report. The CIA’s actions in the immediate aftermath of September 11 attacks have long since ceased. Although President Obama has approved release of the report’s summary, even Secretary of State John Kerry has warned that the report’s release will put Americans and U.S. embassies at risk of retaliation.  &#10;&#10;So why do this now? Perhaps Democrats in Congress think that by excoriating our intelligence community before the entire world they will expiate the sins of the previous administration. Yes, it’s another chance it’s to blame Bush! This is the apology tour on steroids. According to media reports, the report concludes that we tortured terrorists. These are the same terrorists who blew up the World Trade Center, bombed the Pentagon, and tried to level the U.S. Capitol.  &#10;&#10;These are the same terrorists that today have beheaded Christians, Westerners and, just this past weekend, another American citizen. Think back to the days after September 11. We were blind about Al Qaeda. Most Americans feared another attack was imminent. And the best legal advice in government said CIA actions to get that information were legal. So CIA officers did what they thought necessary to protect Americans. A decade later we’re suddenly castigating them for it.  &#10;&#10;Second, the report concludes that the intelligence gathered from CIA’s actions wasn’t effective. Yet that has been disputed by the very people in the Obama administration who used it to track down Usama bin Laden.  &#10;&#10;To quote highly regarded former CIA Director Gen. Michael Hayden, “it is inconceivable to believe that three different CIA directors, and three different Deputy CIA directors, conspired over a seven year period to lie about the program’s effectiveness. Third, there is a rule in foreign policy like the one in medicine. First, do no harm.  &#10;&#10;Public release of this report will do immeasurable harm. It will encourage terrorists around the world to launch revenge attacks. It will cause foreign intelligence agencies to clam up and no longer cooperate with US intelligence for fear that their sources and method will be blown.  &#10;&#10;It will cause every American intelligence officer to go into the defensive crouch -- don’t stick your head out to protect America because years later somebody in government who wants to score political points will chop it off. Finally, take a lesson from history. We did this once before, in the 1970’s, when presidential-hopeful Senator Frank Church launched a widespread investigation of the CIA. It didn’t work, Senator Church’s presidential aspirations never got off the ground. But his handiwork crippled American intelligence gathering for a generation. American agents overseas were killed, foreign intelligence agencies stopped sharing intelligence with us, our own human networks collapsed, and CIA officers played it safe and stopped thinking outside the box. This was one of the reasons a generation later we never knew about a bunch of Islamic extremists in a cave in Afghanistan plotting to take down the Twin Towers.  &#10;&#10;Releasing the report to the public will do considerable harm to our efforts to gather essential intelligence about those hoping to do us harm. It will be a self-inflicted wound. The next time we are caught unprepared it won\'t just be with 747s flying into buildings it could be with weapons too terrible to contemplate.  	There is nothing to be gained by releasing the CIA intelligence report. The&#10;CIA’s actions in the immediate aftermath of September 11 attacks have long&#10;since ceased.&#10;&#10;

(AP Photo/Senate Television)  &#10;&#10;Programing Alert: Author Ralph Peters will be a guest on Fox News Channel\'s "Hannity" on December 9 at 10pm ET.  &#10;&#10;Tuesday’s willful, unnecessary and gratuitously destructive release of the one-sided “torture report” at the insistence of outgoing Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. (backed by the White House) amounts to nothing less than providing aid and comfort to the enemy in wartime.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Can anyone cite one practical good accomplished by releasing this gratuitously destructive report at this time? Will revealing successful practices make us more secure? No.  &#10;&#10;The report provides a propaganda windfall for Islamist fanatics. Will it benefit our allies? No. It exposes those who took great risks to help us in the wake of 9/11. Will it “set the record straight?” No. It distorts the record grotesquely in the interests of political correctness, blame-shifting and short-term political advantage.  &#10;&#10;Over the decades, I’ve respected Senator Feinstein, even when disagreeing with her. Thus, I’m far more shocked by her self-serving release of this report than by anything the CIA did to protect us. One can only conclude that the senator and her acolytes are attempting not to reform our intelligence practices but to re-write their own role in what transpired. The senator and her colleagues (from both parties) were briefed in detail on every activity field agents took to protect us from further attacks. The senator and her colleagues (as well as the Department of Justice) approved every one of those practices.  &#10;&#10;Now, the senator’s saying, “Even if we knew, we didn’t know.” Perhaps she is, indeed, suffering a much-delayed attack of conscience, but the awareness that the incoming Republican-majority Congress would never release such a biased report surely plays a role. And is it an accident that the report’s release—the stuff of commanding headlines—has been timed for the day that Professor “Americans-are-stupid” Jonathan Gruber testifies on Capitol Hill about ObamaCare?  &#10;&#10;What a monstrous betrayal it is to compromise our agents and our allies just to shove a lackey’s testimony below the fold in tomorrow-morning’s newspapers…  &#10;&#10;As for those supposedly horrendous actions taken by CIA personnel to convince blood-encrusted terrorists that cooperation might be the wisest course, they may have been harsh, but the times and our enemies were and are immeasurably harsher. But torture? What the Islamic State and its ilk do to their captives is torture. They shrink from nothing. We shrink from the thought of a terrorist gasping for breath.  &#10;&#10;Senator Feinstein and her supporters argue that the American people have a “right to know,” but they don’t know the American people. Living too long in a bubble with fellow members of the cultural elite, they have no sense of how the average American feels about terrorists who fly passenger aircraft into skyscrapers or who gleefully behead innocent captives in video clips.  &#10;&#10;Far from being mortified by water-boarding or sleep deprivation (for working Americans sleep deprivation is a normal state of affairs from holding down two jobs and multiple shifts to feed their families during the Reign of Obama), the folks I know back home in the Pennsylvania coal towns would skin terrorists alive then get out the salt shaker. My people weren’t upset by water-boarding. They were upset—infuriated—by the collapse of the Twin Towers and the deaths of 3,000 Americans.  &#10;&#10;Of course, the release of this report just now—which may lead to the deaths of more Americans, as the senator has been warned—is another sign of the Obama administration’s desperation. Team Obama’s genius for failure in every policy field, foreign or domestic, has left the administration’s inner circle frantic to deflect attention from its parade of deceptions, derelictions and disasters. About the only thing left to them is to exhume, yet again, the mutilated-by-the-left corpse of the George W. Bush administration.  &#10;&#10;For Team Obama, with its conviction that America’s at the root of every evil, Bush is responsible for the Crucifixion, the Black Death, the Holocaust and Country music. But the average Americans so disdained by this White House (and by Professor Gruber) want to know what President Obama has done for them. And unless one belongs to an arcane interest group, the answer is “Nothing.”  &#10;&#10;By attempting at this late date to vilify the men and women who did the hard, dangerous and unpleasant work of keeping the rest of us safe, Senator Feinstein and her backers create, gratuitously, a real and present danger. They have placed a higher value on the exaggerated “suffering” of barely human monsters than on the safety of our diplomats, our troops, our citizens abroad and our closest allies. (In Obamaworld-logic, it was a crime of the highest order to waterboard mass murderers, but it’s okay to kill them with drone strikes; speaking strictly for myself, I think I’d prefer waterboarding to death.)  &#10;&#10;Even if we grant her the noblest intentions, Senator Feinstein has betrayed our country and its defenders. Will she accept responsibility for the aftermath of this report’s release? The president certainly won’t. Should things go wrong, the White House will give the senator a back-massage by a bus this holiday season.  &#10;&#10;Our enemies would gladly exterminate every man, woman and child in the United States. Senator Feinstein just handed them a gift. But the president wrapped it.  	Tuesday’s willful, unnecessary and gratuitously destructive release of the&#10;one-sided “torture report” at the insistence of outgoing Senate Intelligence&#10;Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. (backed by the White House)&#10;amounts to nothing less that providing aid and comfort to the enemy in&#10;wartime.&#10;&#10;
056-ciainterrogationsreportnewcong	foxnews	2014-12-12T12:00:17Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/12/12/cia-interrogations-report-new-congress-must-tackle-how-to-get-intelligence/	Fay Vincent	CIA interrogations report: New Congress must tackle how to get intelligence right	  &#10;&#10;As I read news reports detailing the Senate Committee Report on the CIA interrogation program after the September 2001 terrorist attacks, I concluded there are several recurring problems to this latest effort to govern our national intelligence agencies.  &#10;&#10;As an old man, I have had the opportunity to have first-hand exposure to how complex it is for Congress or even the White House to assert control over these vital intelligence activities.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;After there were revelations in the 60’s that the CIA had engaged in a variety of activities that were highly questionable including efforts to kill Fidel Castro and others, the Carter administration reacted and went through the kind of political process that many are urging should be done today.  &#10;&#10;In an attempt to purge the agency of its tendency to use nefarious individuals to carry out some of its covert projects, the CIA was directed to refuse to associate with any persons who could not meet the test of good character.  &#10;&#10;One CIA officer told me how absurd that directive was. “We are trying to get people to betray their governments and to lie and cheat on our behalf. You cannot expect us to find those people in the front pew at the local churches.” Perhaps the directive was well-intentioned but it made no sense.  &#10;&#10;Richard Helms, the CIA head from 1966 to 1973, whom I knew well and admired greatly, told me of his personal problems when he was indicted by the Carter Justice Department for perjury. In testimony he gave to the Congress, Helms denied under oath his agency had been involved in the overthrow of the Allende government in Chile, an action ordered by President Nixon.  &#10;&#10;Helms told me he was following instructions he had been given repeatedly by various Senators including such powerful men as Senators Richard Russell and Walter George to the effect that if he were ever asked at an open hearing a question the answer to which “would put any of our people at risk” he should feel free to protect the secrets in whatever manner he wished. Of course Helms knew of many instances when he and others in the Agency had relied on that authority.  &#10;&#10;Helms was defended by the powerful Washington lawyer, Edward Bennett Williams and the case against Helms was quickly resolved when Williams explained to the Justice Department his plan to have Helms take the stand and recite all the covert programs that had been protected by various forms of prevarications by intelligence officials.  &#10;&#10;Of course no such trial in public made any sense and the danger to ongoing intelligence activities of testimony such as Williams would have had Helms provide was so great the ill- advised indictment of Helms resulted only in a slap on the wrist. Williams made a deal in which Helms pled guilty to a misdemeanor with no punishment. Later, President Ronald Reagan gave Helms the National Intelligence Medal as an obvious act of apology.  &#10;&#10;Perjury is not to be condoned and lying before the Congress is criminal conduct. But the intelligence world involves subtle issues. If we want to have a major intelligence effort, there are clear costs to be accepted. One of them is that much of the necessary supervision by Congress has to be done with deft caution. It can hardly be conducted in open hearings.  &#10;&#10;Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard Law Professor and prominent civil libertarian, contends torture to save lives should be permitted as long as there are rigorous procedural safeguards. He points out the Israelis have used torture for years with apparent success. Getting information from unwilling prisoners cannot be done without some risks to civilized process. It can be a dirty game.  &#10;&#10;I once visited Vice President Walter Mondale at his White House office where he served under President Carter from 1977 to 1981. His desk was piled high with documents he said were mainly reports from the CIA. He volunteered his frustration at the then weaknesses at the CIA.  &#10;&#10;He told me he had come to regret he had been such a vigorous supporter of the gutting of that agency that followed the suggestions of the so-called Church Committee on which Mondale had served as a Senator. His comment was an isolated one and I merely listened. But the effects of the Church Committee recommendations were damaging to the CIA and the remedial work took years.  &#10;&#10;Every forty years we may have to endure periodic reports like those produced under Senators Church and Feinstein that represent well intentioned reviews of the intelligence community. The suggested reforms speak of following our sense of justice and fairness and civility. The problem is obvious: Our enemies do not play fair and war is Hell. Any reforms of the intelligence universe cannot easily be effected.  &#10;&#10;The idea of a transparent intelligence agency is an inherent contradiction. Moreover how can Congress talk openly of reforms without damaging our intelligence efforts? And politicians are among those least likely to be willing to accept the secrecy that is at the core of any well managed intelligence agency. Can we imagine a Congress that can keep the secrets?  &#10;&#10;The new flurry of attacks on the intelligence community -- harmful and unnecessary-- will not have any more lasting impact than did the indictment of Helms or the work of the Church Committee. But there should be some quiet and thoughtful debate within our Congress about how it can supervise these vital intelligence programs. After all, our national intelligence work is existential.  	As an old man, I have had the opportunity to have first-hand exposure to how&#10;complex it is for Congress or even the White House to assert control over&#10;vital intelligence activities.&#10;&#10;

When the government is waving at us with its right hand, so to speak, it is the government’s left hand that we should be watching. Just as a magician draws your attention to what he wants you to see so you will not observe how his trick is performed, last week presented a textbook example of public disputes masking hidden deceptions. Here is what happened.  &#10;&#10;Last week was dominated by two huge news stories. One was the revelation by the Senate Intelligence Committee of torture committed by CIA agents and contractors on 119 detainees in the post-9/11 era -- 26 of whom were tortured for months by mistake. In that revelation of anguish and error were the conclusions by CIA agents themselves that their torture had not produced helpful information. President Obama acknowledged that the CIA had tortured, yet he directed the Department of Justice not to prosecute those who tortured and those who authorized it.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;The other substantial news story was the compromise achieved by Congress and the White House to fund the government through the end of September 2015. That legislation, which is 2,000 pages in length, was not read by anyone who voted for it. It spends a few hundred billion dollars more than the government will collect in tax revenue.  &#10;&#10;The compromise was achieved through bribery; members of Congress bought and sold votes by adding goodies (in the form of local expenditures of money borrowed by the federal government) to the bill that were never debated or independently voted upon and were added solely to achieve the votes needed for passage.  &#10;&#10;This is how the federal government operates today. Both parties participate in it. They have turned the public treasury into a public trough.  &#10;&#10;Hidden in the law that authorized the government to spend more than it will collect was a part about funding for the 16 federal civilian intelligence agencies. And hidden in that was a clause, inserted by the same Senate Intelligence Committee that revealed the CIA torture, authorizing the National Security Agency to gather and retain nonpublic data for five years and to share it with law enforcement and with foreign governments. “Nonpublic data” is the government’s language referring to the content of the emails, text messages, telephone calls, bank statements, utility bills and credit card bills of nearly every innocent person in America -- including members of Congress, federal judges, public officials and law enforcement officials. I say “innocent” because the language of this legislation -- which purports to make lawful the NSA spying we now all know about -- makes clear that those who spy upon us needn’t have any articulable suspicion or probable cause for spying.  &#10;&#10;The need for articulable suspicion and probable cause has its origins in the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, which was written to prohibit what Congress just authorized. That amendment was a reaction to the brutish British practice of rummaging through the homes of American colonists, looking for anything that might be illegal. It is also a codification of our natural right to privacy. It requires that if the government wants nonpublic data from our persons, houses, papers or effects, it must first present evidence of probable cause to a judge and then ask the judge for a search warrant.  &#10;&#10;Probable cause is a level of evidence that is sufficient to induce a judge into concluding that it is more likely than not that the place to be examined contains evidence of crimes. In order to seek probable cause, the government must first have an articulable suspicion about the person or place it has targeted. Were this not in the law, then nothing would stop the government from fishing expeditions in pursuit of anyone it wants to pursue. And fishing expeditions turn the presumption of liberty on its head. The presumption of liberty is based on the belief that our rights are natural to us and that we may exercise them without a permission slip from the government and without its surveillance.  &#10;&#10;Until last week, that is. Last week, Congress, by authorizing the massive NSA spying to continue and by authorizing the spies to share what they have seized with law enforcement, basically permitted the fishing expeditions that the Fourth Amendment was written to prevent.  &#10;&#10;How can the president and Congress defy the Constitution, you might ask?  &#10;&#10;Hasn’t every member of the government taken an oath to uphold the Constitution? Doesn’t the Constitution create the presidency and the Congress? How can politicians purport to change it?  &#10;&#10;The answers to these questions are obvious, as is the belief of most of those in government that they can write any law and regulate any behavior and ignore the Constitution they have sworn to uphold whenever they want, so long as they can get away with it.  	Last week presented a textbook example of public disputes masking hidden&#10;deceptions. Here is what happened.&#10;&#10;
058-ciatorturereportcrimepunish	aljazeera	Wed, 10 Dec 2014 10:19:27 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/cia-torture-report-crime-punish-201412108023970176.html	Andy Worthington	Punishment, not apology after CIA torture report	What a dark day for the United States.  &#10;&#10;Five years and nine months after Senators Dianne Feinstein and Kit Bond, the chair and vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, announced a review of the CIA's detention and interrogation programme in the so-called "war on terror", the 500-page executive summary of that report has been made publicly available.  &#10;&#10;Its conclusions are shocking. As Feinstein explained in an interview with the Los Angeles Times at the weekend, "We have to get this report out. Anybody who reads this is going to never let this happen again."  &#10;&#10;Let us hope so - and let us also hope that senior officials in the Bush administration, as well as senior CIA personnel, will eventually be held accountable for their actions.  &#10;&#10;The CIA's torture programme, initiated almost immediately after the 9/11 attacks, remained a closely guarded secret for many years. An early revelation was a June 2004 leak of a memo which purported to redefine torture so that it could be used by the CIA. The memo was written by John Yoo, a lawyer in the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), who was close to Dick Cheney.  &#10;&#10;The CIA's "black sites" in Europe were not publicly exposed until November 2005. The Bush administration still refused to openly acknowledge the programme until September 2006, when then President George W Bush announced that, with the arrival of 14 "high-value detainees" at Guantanamo from various "black sites", the programme he had denied the existence of until that time had now closed down.  &#10;&#10;That statement, we subsequently learned, was not entirely true, as a few other prisoners arrived at Guantanamo from CIA custody in 2007 and 2008, but the torture report provides conclusive proof.  &#10;&#10;"By March 2006," the report states, "the programme was operating in only one country. The CIA last used its enhanced interrogation techniques on November 8, 2007. The CIA did not hold any detainees after April 2008."  &#10;&#10;After the arrival of the "high-value detainees" at Guantanamo, numerous attempts were made to pierce the veil of secrecy that surrounded the programme. In 2007, Swiss Senator Dick Marty published an influential report for the Council of Europe about secret prisons and rendition in Europe.  &#10;&#10;In February 2008, CIA Director Michael Hayden admitted that three "high-value detainees" had been subjected to waterboarding. In December 2008, the Senate Armed Services Committee published a powerful report about how the policies for dealing with prisoners in the "war on terror" had developed - including detailed analysis of how the US military's SERE programme (intended to train US personnel to resist torture if captured by a hostile enemy) had been reverse-engineered for the "war on terror".  &#10;&#10;In April 2009, harrowing interviews with the 14 "high-value detainees", conducted by representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross, were leaked, and in August 2009 an internal CIA report from 2004 into the agency's detention and interrogation policies after 9/11 was released containing details of how one prisoner, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri (one of the three men waterboarded, along with Abu Zubaydah and Khalid Sheikh Muhammad), was physically abused and threatened with a gun and power drill while hooded at a "black site" in Thailand.  &#10;&#10;In 2010 I wrote a detailed analysis of the secret detention programme for a UN study, in which I sought to ascertain the identities of the 94 "ghost prisoners" in CIA custody - including 28 subjected to "enhanced interrogation" - who were referred to in a memo from 2005 by OLC lawyer Steven G Bradbury that was released by the Obama administration in April 2009. Another major report, by the Constitution Project, was published in 2013.  &#10;&#10;And yet, although some of the gruesome facts about the torture programme were known, the Senate Intelligence Committee's report provides far more. In its "Findings and Conclusions", for example, the report states:  &#10;&#10;There are many more examples. The report states:  &#10;&#10;In addition, "sleep deprivation involved keeping detainees awake for up to 180 hours", and although some "experienced disturbing hallucinations", in at least two cases the CIA continued its abuse.  &#10;&#10;These examples - and many more in the summary - demonstrate clearly the committee's conclusion that the interrogations "were brutal and far worse than the CIA represented to policymakers and others".  &#10;&#10;Perhaps more importantly, however, the committee also concludes that torture was "not an effective means of acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees", that the CIA made "inaccurate claims" about the "effectiveness" of the programme in an attempt to justify it and that it led to friction with other agencies that endangered national security, as well as providing false statements that led to costly and worthless wild goose chases.  &#10;&#10;The report also concludes that non-approved techniques were used widely, and that "[a]t least 17 detainees were subjected to CIA enhanced interrogation techniques without authorisation from CIA headquarters", and that "multiple detainees were subjected to techniques that were applied in ways that diverged from the specific authorisation, or were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques by interrogators who had not been authorised to use them".  &#10;&#10;The committee was also critical of the central role played by two contract psychologists from the SERE programme, even though neither of them "had any experience as an interrogator, nor did either have specialised knowledge of al-Qaeda, a background in counterterrorism, or any relevant cultural or linguistic expertise".  &#10;&#10;The committee also concluded that Steven Bradbury's numbers were wrong, and that the CIA "detained at least 119 individuals, of whom at least 39 were subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques". Moreover, of these 119 "at least 26 were wrongfully held and did not meet the detention standard" in the still-secret Bush administration memorandum establishing the programme in September 2001.  &#10;&#10;In the days and weeks to come, there will be concerted efforts by the CIA and by former Bush administration officials to defend their actions, but the report makes clear that any kind of defence is untenable. Crimes were committed, authorised at the highest level of the US government, and, although Obama came into office in 2009 expressing "a belief that we need to look forward as opposed to looking backwards", that is not acceptable.  &#10;&#10;The Senate Intelligence Committee's torture report - all 6,700 pages of it, costing $40m and involving an analysis of more than six million pages of classified documents - must be the trigger not just for an airing of apologies, but for those who instigated and authorised the torture programme to be held accountable - up to and including President George W Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney.  	After the shock of the CIA torture report, those responsible for the programme&#10;must be held accountable.&#10;&#10;

That's government-speak for torture. It was the first public accounting of what that programme actually entailed, and as one of the most controversial topics in Washington, is sure to create a political firestorm on both the left and the right, not to mention around the world, for many months to come.  &#10;&#10;In short, it was shocking. It was ugly. It should lead no doubt to the reader that the programme was as wrong as it was useless. And it can never be permitted to happen again.  &#10;&#10;The CIA's torture programme was authorised by then President George W Bush in August 2002, giving them broad discretion in the use of harsh interrogation techniques that included waterboarding, sleep deprivation, hypothermia, stress positions, abdomen strikes, slapping and forced shaking. Its stated purpose was to solicit actionable intelligence that might save American lives. In effect, it gave carte blanche for interrogators to do pretty much anything they wanted from a laundry list of macabre techniques to extract that information. To those behind the programme, the moral question was perversely inconsequential, as they all too readily adopted the Machiavellian philosophy of "the end justifies the means".  &#10;&#10;In methodical fashion, SSCI laid out its case through 20 findings and conclusions, followed by detailed supporting chapters tying them all together.  &#10;&#10;Abysmal failure  &#10;&#10;Nearly 500 pages in length, it was a mere, yet chilling, fraction of the overall report, which will remain classified. But the message was clear. The torture programme, despite what its supporters claimed at the time, and continue to do so even now, was an abysmal failure and disgrace for the US.  &#10;&#10;In its very first finding, which set the stage for what was to follow, SSCI concluded the use of torture was not an "effective means of acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees". And most disturbingly, right from the beginning, CIA officers routinely called into question the programme's effectiveness in producing accurate intelligence.  &#10;&#10;Yet, their leadership turned a blind eye to those concerns, ignoring numerous internal critiques, criticisms and objections from those charged with carrying out the grisly day-to-day operations. There were even instances when interrogators were ordered to continue torturing certain detainees who they had already assessed as being cooperative. This is what we call a crisis in leadership - both at the CIA and at the highest levels of the Bush Administration.  &#10;&#10;Incredibly, of the 20 examples most often used by the CIA to show how successful their torture programme was, all were determined to be fundamentally wrong or misleading. Case in point: In their representations to the White House, National Security Council, Department of Justice, Congress and the American people, the CIA often referred to Abu Zubaydah as "proof" that those methods provided real, actionable intelligence that saved American lives.  &#10;&#10;Zubaydah, a senior al-Qaeda figure, was captured in Pakistan in March 2002. Several months later, after the torture programme was authorised, he was subjected to numerous and repeated torture techniques, to include being waterboarded 83 times.  &#10;&#10;According to former Bush Administration and CIA officials involved in the programme at the time, Zubaydah - as a direct result of his being waterboarded - not only provided information that allowed the FBI to disrupt the Jose Padilla "Dirty Bomb Plot" in Chicago, but also identified Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;There's only one problem with that story. It wasn't true. According to the SSCI report, the FBI actually obtained that information from Zubaydah through legal interrogation techniques between March and June 2002, and provided it to the CIA months before he was ever subjected to waterboarding or any other torture techniques.  &#10;&#10;According to the FBI interrogators, they had developed a rapport with Zubaydah, who was cooperating with them. And yet, the CIA decided to subject him to torture. Maybe Zubaydah repeated that information as a result of waterboarding, but the official record reflects that it certainly wasn't the first time the CIA ever heard about it. And that's pretty much it when it comes to "actionable intelligence" gained through the CIA's use of torture. None. Nada. Zip. Seriously?  &#10;&#10;But it gets worse. Beginning with Zubaydah, the first CIA detainee to undergo torture, and continuing on with numerous others, the techniques went on for days or weeks at a time. There were physical beatings, mock executions, sleep deprivations for days at a time while standing with hands chained above their heads, and threats to sexually assault or kill detainees' family members.  &#10;&#10;One detainee even died, apparently of hypothermia, after being chained nearly naked to a cement floor. Reading the report, one has to ask how the US, or any country for that matter could morally justify what was done. It can't.  &#10;&#10;The final finding and conclusion was an understatement, in that the CIA's torture programme "damaged the United States' standing in the world". And that's something the US isn't going to get over any time soon. As a longtime global leader in human rights issues, particularly on the subject of torture, the US has lost its moral credibility on the world stage.  &#10;&#10;Law of the land  &#10;&#10;The first step in ending the torture programme was accomplished in 2009, when US President Barack Obama signed an executive order banning it shortly after taking office. That's the law of the land in the US right now. However, when Obama leaves office in 2016, there's nothing to stop his successor from authorising it again. Except, of course, the court of public opinion, which is why the release of this report was so important. In a recent Pew Research report, half the US public polled thought torture could be justified sometimes or even often.  &#10;&#10;The second step happened last night with SSCI's public release of their report summary. No doubt, those who are still in favour the torture programme, particularly the former Bush Administration and the CIA officials closely involved with it, will aggressively refute the facts laid out in SSCI's report. Let them.  &#10;&#10;Then, it's time to have a frank and informed discussion on the whole torture issue, separating the facts from the myths. The American public and its leaders need to ask themselves if torture is how they really want to be defined. Does the end really justify the means?  &#10;&#10;After reading the report, one would have to wonder how it could. Torture is wrong, plain and simple. The US needs to reject it outright now, while the report, in all its shocking and macabre detail, is fresh in the public's mind. Otherwise, they'll find themselves going back down that path again the next time fear and panic take hold.

These were dozens of small restaurants but, like the painted roses in Alice in Wonderland, they were uniformly decorated and equipped. Everything was bright red. The colour of Coca-Cola.  &#10;&#10;Coke’s sponsorship paid for the menus offering meal deals including everybody’s favourite fizzy pop, the fridges sporting logos and the T-shirts and red Coca-Cola aprons of every waiter behind every counter. But to say the soft drinks brand had a marketing monopoly would be to understate what was going on here. Few people object to this Coca-Colanisation. The soft drink has cult status in Mexico. There is even a church that was said to use it instead of wine for communion.  &#10;&#10;Mexico has one of the highest levels of child obesity in the world. Sugary drinks, foremost of which in popularity is Coke, have a lot to do with that, according to the Mexican obesity experts I interviewed. So when the London Eye, the most famous big wheel in the UK, announced it would turn red courtesy of Coca-Cola, I found it hard to repress a shudder.  &#10;&#10;It’s the normalisation of Coca-Cola that worries me – its insinuation into our lives. In London it’s hard to get away from the Eye. You glimpse it unexpectedly all the time. The corporation doesn’t need slogans or the jingly tunes it once employed to get into our heads. We know what the red on the wheel represents. And it is red, of course – the full sugar colour. Not the green of the lower sugar brand, nor the black of Coke Zero.  &#10;&#10;We may be more sceptical of it than those in remote parts of Mexico where people were grateful for the delivery van because they had no safe drinking water. But it is part of our culture too, as the company points out on its website. It arrived in London in 1900 when Charles Candler, son of the founder, brought over a jug of syrup from the US. In 1969, Coca-Cola teamed up with Biba for a TV ad featuring Carnaby Street and a recording of Things Go Better with Coke by The Who. And in 2012, there was the sponsorship of the Olympics by both Coca-Cola and McDonald’s.  &#10;&#10;Marketing and advertising have become much subtler, particularly in the hands of vast corporations with huge profits and products that are under attack from health lobbies. Jingles have given way to associations, to dreams and nostalgia. And the format has changed. Online advertising outdid TV ads in 2009. Social media is a gift. Young people can be invited to join in with cool groups of online friends who have the good taste to like certain drinks, snacks or – on the case of children – sweets. The Yale Rudd Center for food policy and obesity in the US reported that 6 billion fast-food ads appeared on Facebook in 2012, which amounted to 19% of all fast-food advertising. The World Health Organisation in a report on Europe warned of “advergames” - game playing and fantasy video sites launched online by snack and sweet companies.  &#10;&#10;So no – we don’t worship Coca-Cola in Britain or see its presence on our dinner table as a status symbol. But do we really want our children to see and one day nostalgically remember the magnificent spectacle of the Eye on the London skyline bathed for years to come in Coca-Cola red? At least we can turn off the TV.  &#10;&#10;• Sarah Boseley is the author of The Shape We’re in: how junk food and diets and shortening our lives, published by Guardian Faber.  	Sarah Boseley: Coca-Cola may not enjoy the cult status it has in Mexico but modern marketing tactics such as turning the London Eye Coke-red ring alarm bells
061-confessionsofteenageshoplifter	guardian	2015-01-20T16:36:59Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/20/confessions-of-teenage-shoplifter-241	Anonymous	Confessions of a teenage shoplifter	I couldn’t help letting out a low whistle of admiration when I read news that the cost of goods stolen in the average shoplifting incident is now £241. Bloody hell, I thought, as I tried to imagine how exactly you would stash that many eye-shadow compacts up your sleeve. You see for a few months back when I was 16, shoplifting was the hottest craze at my suburban girls school. It spread like a virus through Year 11, to the point that students would pop into town at lunch and return with a huge cache of stolen goods. They’d upturn the contents of their bags on to a desk with a shout of: “Who wants what?” Now, the thieves providing the British Retail Consortium with a headache this week with their high-cost hauls are more likely to be professional “steal to order” shoplifters, not a gang of feckless teenage girls. Nevertheless, it instantly brought back that rush of adrenaline that always follows a bout of five-finger discount “shopping”.  &#10;&#10;It all began with a couple of girls nicking a few small items of makeup and jewellery – and then we realised how easy it was. It was almost impossible to get caught. Why choose one eyeshadow, when you could have it in every colour? Why bother trying to find the right shade of foundation, when you could just take one of each? In any case, there would always be someone at school who would want it – or at least be impressed by it.  &#10;&#10;As the weeks went by things escalated. We went after bigger prizes. I vividly remember the thrill of the day I walked out of Topshop with two bikinis on under my clothes, alongside my best friend, brazenly wearing a stolen denim jacket over hers. We graduated from our local town centre to field trips to the nearest shopping mall. On the train back we would compare our hauls and swap stories. How the security guard didn’t notice the Buffy the Vampire Slayer boxset stuffed up my mate’s jumper. How the Venus razor blade hadn’t set off the alarm in Boots, but in the book shop, leading to suspicious looks but escape. At school, when our teachers warned us that they wouldn’t lend out French dictionaries to those who forgot to bring their own to the oral exam, we sent a couple of girls into town to empty WH Smith of its stock. On their return they defiantly plonked a stack on the desk for anyone who needed one.  &#10;&#10;I remember discussing what we should tell our parents when they asked questions about where our new clothes came from, but don’t remember anyone raising the moral alarm. Far from being unable to sleep at night, I would go to bed dreaming of new things to “jack” and innovative ways to do it. Yes, I had worries about being caught but, as far as I can remember, there was no guilt whatsoever. It seemed like the perfect victimless crime. After all, we were stealing from chain stores that had plenty more. Looking back, it seems ludicrous that it ever felt so normal. What happened to us? We weren’t stealing through need – most of us got pocket money from our parents and had more than enough clothes to wear. Maybe it was that particularly hot summer, or the pressure of our looming GCSEs. Or maybe we were greedy little consumerists with an overdeveloped sense of entitlement and no moral compass.  &#10;&#10;Who knows? I would like to say we came to our senses and decided to stop, but that’s not true. The worst happened and two good friends were caught and arrested. They were let off with a caution – because their loot had included a GCSE maths revision guide.  &#10;&#10;We’re all upstanding members of the community now, with proper jobs and the inclination to pay for goods. I’ve learned there’s no such thing as a victimless crime. Stores close, prices go up, maybe wages get kept down because of losses due to shoplifting. But habits built up during that summer of madness die hard. I still occasionally find myself in a shop thinking: “How silly. If they’re not going to put a security tag on those expensive silk shirts, they really shouldn’t put them right near the door.”  	Anonymous: News that the shoplifter’s average haul is worth £241 brings back memories of my own moments of madness
062-connecticutsupremecourtsaveste	foxnews	2015-01-08T20:52:55Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/01/08/connecticut-supreme-court-saves-teen-life/	Gregg Jarrett	Connecticut Supreme Court saves teen's life	  &#10;&#10;The Justices of the Connecticut Supreme Court took over parenting duties of a cancer-stricken teenager Thursday. In so doing, they surely saved her life.  &#10;&#10;At the conclusion of oral arguments, the high court took just minutes to determined that state officials were right to take custody of the girl known in court documents only as “Cassandra C.” and force her to undergo life-saving treatment. No thanks to her mother.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Jackie Fortin had encouraged her 17-year-old daughter’s desire to refuse chemotherapy. She naively pronounced, “my daughter is not going to die.” As if wishing it could make it come true.  &#10;&#10;Sadly, both mother and daughter were wrong. They were in denial. If they got their way, Cassandra would die. It was the equivalent of suicide. I wonder how her mother would feel then?  &#10;&#10;Cassandra has advanced Hodgkin\'s lymphoma which attacks and consumes the body’s immune system. Her doctors say chemotherapy treatment will give her an 85 percent chance of survival. Excellent odds. Yet, the teenager refused, saying she did not want to “poison” her body with chemo.  &#10;&#10;How does that make sense to a rational mind? Let’s employ Cassandra’s own tortured terminology and logic.  &#10;&#10;Does she not realize that her body is already being poisoned by the rapidly multiplying cancer in her lymph system? Untreated, it will quickly spread until it kills her. That is what her doctors predict. Reliable statistics from the National Cancer Institute prove they are right.  &#10;&#10;Chemotherapy can save her. Chemicals are introduced into the diseased body to attack the cancer cells. You can call it a “poison” if you want, but a more accurate term is curative. Yes, the chemicals also harm other normal cells. To that extent they are a poison, of sorts, producing painful and unpleasant side effects. But once the body recovers and is free of the cancer cells, the chemicals are gone.  &#10;&#10;Thus, if chemo is a poison, it is not normally a lethal one. The cancer which is ravaging Cassandra’s body surely is.  &#10;&#10;If, by using the term “poison,” Cassandra means she does not want to endure the side effects of nausea, vomiting, hair loss and exhaustion, she is being myopic. The final stages of untreated lymphoma are far more extreme and painful.  &#10;&#10;Cassandra’s disdain for the treatment that will likely save her young life is, perhaps, the best evidence that she was not mature enough to make a wise and informed decision on her own. But then again, neither was her mother. Which is why the state of Connecticut stepped in.  &#10;&#10;As an adult, Fortin, is presumed to be competent under the law to make decisions for her daughter, a minor. However, Fortin’s aberrant judgment in rejecting the treatment that could save Cassandra’s life and her concomitant belief that her daughter would somehow, miraculously, not succumb to an insidious, fatal illness… called that legal presumption into serious doubt.  &#10;&#10;There is also evidence that Fortin ignored obvious signs of her daughter’s malignant disease at an early stage, failed to seek prompt and continuing medical attention, and has been unduly influencing Cassandra’s negative reaction to treatment. The court records suggest a domineering mother with an abiding distrust of medicine, and a daughter fearful of running afoul of her mother’s wishes.  &#10;&#10;To deny a child beneficial, life-sustaining treatment constitutes child neglect. States have a duty to protect children from abuse and neglect. Courts rarely hesitate to step in where a child’s life is in danger.  &#10;&#10;Thus, the state was correct to intervene and the lower court was equally correct to remove the mother as unfit. Fortunately, the Connecticut Supreme Court agreed and did the right thing.  &#10;&#10;Time is on Cassandra’s side. The fact that she is 9 months away from turning 18 years old may, in the end, have saved her life. It gave the high court an excuse to adhere strictly to the law as it relates to protecting minors. Those 9 months will also give doctors valuable time to complete her therapy and give her a new chance at a full and happy life.  &#10;&#10;As for her mother, Jackie Fortin? She will have ample time to wrestle with her conscience.  	The Justices of the Connecticut Supreme Court took over parenting duties of a&#10;cancer-stricken teenager. In so doing, they surely saved her life.&#10;&#10;
063-couldindianagovmikepencebeourn	foxnews	2014-12-16T12:00:53Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/12/16/could-indiana-gov-mike-pence-be-our-next-president/	Cal Thomas	Could Indiana Gov. Mike Pence be our next president?	  &#10;&#10;INDIANAPOLIS – If success at the state level were enough to recommend someone for president of the United States, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana would be among the frontrunners for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination.  &#10;&#10;According to the governor’s office, Pence has “signed into law $643 million in annual tax relief: That includes: $313 million for hardworking Hoosiers, thanks to last year’s 5 percent income tax reduction, the largest state tax cut in Indiana history.”  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;In addition, the state corporate tax rate was reduced from 6.5 percent to 4.9 percent, making it the third lowest in the country and contributing to Indiana’s increase in the labor force, which, Pence’s office says, has grown by more than 51,000 over the past year, five times the national growth rate.  &#10;&#10;It helps to have large majorities of one’s party in the legislature, but Pence consults and has good relationships with Democrats, who frequently vote with the Republican majority because his programs work.  &#10;&#10;Sitting with the governor in his high-ceiling office beneath portraits of two Indiana governors who became presidents of the United States — William Henry Harrison and Benjamin Harrison — Pence tells me he is focused on the upcoming legislative session, which is expected to last four months, and won’t think seriously about running for president until the session ends. Then, he says, “We’ll probably take some time as a family to reflect and pray and make decisions about our future.”  &#10;&#10;In his mind, Pence may have already crafted a winning scenario. He may be focused on his state, but he thinks a lot about the country, which he served for 10 years as a congressman.  &#10;&#10;A former Democrat (like his ideological mentor Ronald Reagan), Pence sees a need to transform his party’s image: “The Republican Party has become just the other party to Washington solutions. We have to get back to advancing state- based solutions and reforms. We must be relentlessly optimistic.”  &#10;&#10;He paraphrases a Reagan line: “‘Why shouldn’t we dream great dreams, after all we’re Americans.’ There was a confidence and optimism I think our party would do well to repair to. … There’s a lot wrong with our national government, but we’ve got to stop confusing our national government with our nation.”  &#10;&#10;That’s a good line for a stump speech.  &#10;&#10;Pence wants to move from opposing bad ideas in Washington, to focusing on the success records in many states. For example, Pence’s education agenda includes a goal of taking children in underperforming schools and putting them in good schools: “By the year 2020, I want 100,000 more Indiana students in high- quality schools than we have today. Today, we have 105,000 kids who are in underperforming or failing schools.”  &#10;&#10;He wants to fix traditional schools, pay good teachers more, giving bonuses to the best, and expand vocational education to every high school in the state. “We have the largest education voucher program in America. I want to expand that by lifting the cap and encouraging more private investment.” Indiana also has 75 charter schools.  &#10;&#10;Pence declines an invitation to comment on former Gov. Jeb Bush’s recent remarks about having to lose the primary in order to win the general election, which many conservatives view as an attack on the party’s base.  &#10;&#10;If Hillary Clinton becomes the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee, I asked, is she beatable?  &#10;&#10;Pence answers indirectly, saying he thinks 2016 will be the first foreign policy election since 1980 and that as a former secretary of state, Clinton will have some advantages. That’s why he thinks the eventual GOP nominee should do as George W. Bush did in 2000: name a group of advisers with strong foreign policy credentials to advise him during a campaign and, if he is successful, some might serve in his administration.  &#10;&#10;Mike Pence is a model of humility and restraint. While some characterize Obama as a failed president, Pence will only label his tenure “disappointing.” That in itself is in sharp contrast to the hubris, narcissism and self-awareness of Obama.  &#10;&#10;Humility, coupled with a proven track record of success and more confidence in the states and the people, is what’s needed at the national level. Mike Pence could be the one to bring it.  	If success at the state level were enough to recommend someone for president&#10;of the United States, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana would be among the&#10;frontrunners for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination.&#10;&#10;

The fall of Mosul and the quick territorial expansion of ISIL in Iraq took some by surprise. What contributed to ISIL's quick success was cooperation from local Sunni tribes and members of the traditionally secular and nationalist Baath party. This seemingly counterintuitive alliance has its rationale and deep roots in history.  &#10;&#10;The successful cooperation between radical Islamist factions, Sunni tribes and representatives of the former ruling party - currently commanders of paramilitary groups - can be traced back to the policies of Saddam Hussein in the early 1980s, which aimed to foster closer ties between those espousing the ideas of political Islam and the Baath party.  &#10;&#10;The historical preconditions for the advent of Islamist ideas in Iraq and their eager adoption by Sunni resistance forces are clearly discernible in the strategy proposed at the time by the then Iraqi president.  &#10;&#10;In 1986, at a meeting with representatives of the pan-Arab national command - the supreme ideological body of the Baath Party - Saddam Hussein offered a ceasefire, or even an alliance, between the party and the Muslim Brotherhood movement in Egypt and Sudan. In practice, for the first time in its history the militant and secular Baath party declared its readiness to cooperate with representatives of the so-called political Islam.  &#10;&#10;In the same year, the Iraqi president also defined the difference between the "democratic, national, pan-Arab state" and the "religious state" proclaimed by the Muslim Brotherhood. Following in the footsteps of the founding father of Arab nationalism and of the pan-Arab Baath party Michel Aflaq, Saddam clearly declared that he was not an atheist, but warned against any attempt to establish a religious party with an either Sunni or Shia bias. Saddam's warning at the time was probably addressed at the Islamic Dawa party, which had a dominant role among the Shia community and was regarded as the main competitor of the Baath party.  &#10;&#10;The president also rejected the traditional Islamic system of justice and denounced Islamic law as an obsolete legal tradition.  &#10;&#10;It was only after 1990s that Saddam decided to focus on relations with Islamic movements and publications dedicated to the topic began to appear in the media. The conditions could not have been more favourable because the war with Iran had ended and the propaganda machine was busy painting a picture of Saddam as the indisputable victor, despite the enormous war-related losses.  &#10;&#10;In 1991, Iraq launched a new campaign, which Saddam described as "the mother of all battles" against the United States and its allies. The president was yet again depicted as a hero in the confrontation between Muslims and western forces; the inscription "God is Great" was added to the Iraqi flag, and the president promised that he would free Jerusalem. An attempt was made to play down the failure of the campaign in Kuwait and the sanctions imposed by stepping up an openly pro-Islamic propaganda.  &#10;&#10;In 1993, under the weight of a crippling international embargo, the Iraqi president declared the beginning of the so-called religious campaign.  &#10;&#10;The goal was to gain control over religious sentiment among the Iraqi population, which was barely coping with the consequences of the two wars and the stringent sanctions. Last but not least, an attempt was made to reinvent and soften the image of the Baghdad regime as one that is pro-Islamic and, therefore, in conflict with the "forces of Islam's enemies".  &#10;&#10;The regime undertook demonstrative moves such as closing night clubs and some restaurants and enforcing restrictions on alcohol sales. A large scale Quran studying campaign was undertaken. Senior Sunni and Shia clerics took advantage of the situation and attempted to further the interests of their respective communities, declaring open support for the line taken by the Iraqi leader. In 1998, top-ranking party officials, including Vice President Izzat Ibrahim al- Douri, were openly demonstrating religious piety and devotion.  &#10;&#10;The period after 1993 ushered in a renewed mosque building effort. In 1989, a new religious university was founded and named after Saddam. The influence of radical Sunni teachings increasingly gained prominence in certain intellectual circles within Baghdad University. While one group openly espoused extreme conservative views, which today can be described as Salafi beliefs, the other blended in with the Sunni theosophical tradition and was influenced by the teachings of the Naqshbandiyya Order. According to witness testimonies, both groups received financial and moral support from the same source - Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri. A member of the academic community has even alleged that the vice president's support came with the blessing of Saddam.  &#10;&#10;The spread of the new ideology that lay at the very heart of the religious campaign began to make inroads into the judicial system, with the incorporation of extreme and previously unknown punishments into the body of law. By way of example, according to Decree No 59/1994 theft became punishable by amputation.  &#10;&#10;The events that are currently unfolding in Iraq warrant the conclusion that the advent of ISIL and its support from or collaboration with Iraqi Sunni structures would have been impossible without the historical preconditions outlined above having already been firmly set in place.  &#10;&#10;The former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki failed to strike a reasonable balance between the interests of all ethnic and religious groups in the country by systematically marginalising the Sunni community.  &#10;&#10;Another important reason is widespread corruption and the lack of a concept and strategy for the development of the country on the basis of the established constitutional order that is shared by all groups in society. From 2003 to date, no Iraqi government has initiated and proposed an adequate policy for Sunni inclusion.  &#10;&#10;The programme for the de-Baathificaton of senior-ranking party officials (whose number some commentators put at more than 40,000) has resulted in many losing their livelihood. Due to its affiliation with the party, approximately one-third of the Iraqi population was effectively marginalised.  &#10;&#10;Scores of people - many of them young people, including officers in Saddam's army and former civil servants - have been stripped of the Baathist ideology that they previously espoused and that had dominated their social life.  &#10;&#10;This void has been filled by Islam. Since 2004, many Iraqi Sunnis have joined the ranks of the Iraqi resistance movement, which brings together a number of prominent groups under its banner, such as the Naqshbandiyya Army, Al-Awda, Al-Qiyada al-Amma li Jaysh Al-Iraq (General Command of the Iraqi Army), Munazzamat al-Tahrir al-Iraqiya (Iraqi Liberation Organisation), Kataib Salah ad-Din (Salah al-Din Brigades), etc. Despite the radical narrative so typical for purely Islamic organisations, those mentioned continue to rely on the propaganda postulates formerly employed by Saddam as cornerstones of their public rhetoric.  &#10;&#10;The crisis in Iraq has much clearer outlines today than it did a year ago, largely due to the refusal of the government to consider Sunni demands. It has logically escalated with the advent of ISIL from Syria and the forging of a strategic alliance with the main Sunni military groups.  &#10;&#10;At heart, these alliances represent the interests of the former members of the Baath party and of the principal Sunni tribal unions. Their attitude towards the Shia is strongly negative and clearly discernible in a number of claims with a conspiratorial bias. Propaganda describes the Shia in a discriminatory manner, dating back to the medieval period of confrontation between the two communities. These include terms such as shu'ubiyya and safawiya*. The same derogatory terms are also typical for ISIL propaganda.  &#10;&#10;Without equating ISIL and Iraqi opposition, they are apparently, albeit temporarily, aligned in the pursuit of a common goal - bringing about the demise of the government in Baghdad, which is regarded as a direct proponent of the interests of Iran and its ambition to dominate the Sunnis in the Middle East. This alliance, coupled with the markedly fragmented Iraqi political elite, has placed the country at a crossroads. The extremist Islamism, compounded by the opportunism of the former political and military elite, has failed to be countered by an ideology based on a new national compromise. Or, as a senior-ranking international representative has declared, it is imperative that Iraqi citizens consider whether they can still live within the borders of a single state.  	The legacy of Saddam Hussein's Baathist regime facilitated the success of ISIL&#10;in Iraq.&#10;&#10;

News that was so desired, that it seemed impossible.  &#10;&#10;A foreign friend was amazed by the quietness in Havana during the first hours. Because of the way it happened and what it means for the island, there is a feeling of parenthesis that softens opinions.  &#10;&#10;After half-a-century of progressive shortages, fatigue, and the inevitable time it will take for changes to materialise, it took regular Cubans awhile to assimilate the surprising news. Cuba is not a country of what you might call "authored opinions" with a variety of interpretations. The outcome of this event may be a continuation of opposing political opinions between those who resist the regime and those who write an obituary to it every day.  &#10;&#10;Cuba and the US' disagreement didn't start with the Fidel Castro revolution, but with a struggle during colonial times. Cuba was the ungrateful daughter of the Spanish metropolis and the contemptuous bride of the emerging new world metropolis. The clumsy reaction of the US, which included military occupations and transnational power games such as the obstinate blockade of the island, has now suddenly lost some of its arguments. Just two days ago it was punishing banks and international companies for having relations with the island, which the US had designated as a state sponsor of terror.  &#10;&#10;Wednesday's announcement foreshadows actions towards the normalisation of relations. This ranges from economy to diplomacy, and will require a good temper at every step. Obama's speech acknowledges the failure of the blockade, held by successive US governments for over 50 years. On his side, the Cuban president made a call for equanimity and presented the news as patriotic and nationalistic encouragement.  &#10;&#10;It turns out that we are in front of a new stage. Cuba was, possibly, the least Americanised of the nations in the hemisphere, and it has lived a long chapter under a completely opposing ideology. Several generations of Cubans have never known the capitalistic past mythicised by its adversaries. Many have only lived under the blockade, with sacrifices, resignations and daily efforts.  &#10;&#10;It would be adventurous to attribute my impressions to the whole community, since, although I would like to be optimistic about the hopeful impact of the news, I write with the caution and life experience of a scalded cat.  	It took Cubans a while to react to the news of renewed US-Cuba relations.&#10;&#10;

Thus, now is the time to make some observations about Kim's North Korea. What has remained the same, and what has changed since December 2011?  &#10;&#10;The dawn of Kim's rule was marked by intense purges of his father's top dignitaries. In December 2011, during his father's funeral, Kim walked next to his father's hearse in the company of three top generals and four top civilian officials. Three years on, none of these people have their jobs: At least one of them was executed, while all but one have disappeared without a trace.  &#10;&#10;Kim's decision to arrest and execute Chang Song-taek, his aunt's husband, long the "grey eminence" of Pyongyang politics, was a dramatic signal to the elite. The sorry fate of Chang was meant to show that nobody is immune from the wrath of the supreme leader.  &#10;&#10;These purges were obviously necessary to start changing the country, since Kim's policies will be very different from those of his father and grandfather.  &#10;&#10;So far, the most important changes can be seen in the field of economic management. From late 2012, the North Korean government began to implement reforms which are remarkably similar to what China did in the early days of Deng Xiaoping, around 1980. Farmers, who were hitherto government employees with a fixed salary, are now given a certain percentage of the harvest, and have predictably started to feel motivated. As a result, the food situation has improved markedly.  &#10;&#10;In industry, a slow-motion switch from a Leninist, centrally planned economy to markets has been initiated as well. The unofficial private economy, far more advanced in North Korea than most imagine, is now quietly encouraged.  &#10;&#10;There is no sign of relaxation in the political sphere, however. Kim has launched a massive crackdown on illegal border movements, effectively closing North Korea's border with China - which had remained porous for decades. He has also done much to root out the penchant that many North Koreans have recently developed for smuggled foreign TV shows, especially South Korean soap operas and films. Such concerns are not merely motivated by paranoia, regardless of what the international media says. The supreme leader knows that his position is precarious, and that tightening the screws of social control and surveillance may help him prolong his rule.  &#10;&#10;North Korea under Kim remains as stubborn in its nuclear ambitions as it was under his father. Having seen the US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the popular rebellion against Libya's Gaddafi that was indirectly assisted by western might, North Korean decision-makers have every reason to want to continue to advance their nuclear weapons potential.  &#10;&#10;At the same time, there has also been a truly unprecedented crisis in Sino- North Korean relations. In the last years of Kim Jong-il, China was North Korea's major sponsor and trade partner. Now things are different. The Chinese and North Korean media (strictly controlled by the government in both countries) have exchanged thinly veiled verbal attacks, while the Chinese government has frozen all Beijing-sponsored infrastructure projects in North Korea - including, for example, a new bridge over the Yalu River.  &#10;&#10;The North Korean government under Kim has shown hitherto unprecedented interest in foreign investment, as long as this investment comes from sources other than China. At present, the young marshal has pinned his hopes on Russia - currently itself on a collision course with the West. North Korean leaders obviously believe that Russia under Vladimir Putin will behave like the Soviet Union once did and shower North Korea with aid grants as a reward for Pyongyang's militant anti-Americanism. Such hopes are misplaced, but it will take some time before Pyongyang's decision-makers realise the sad truth.  &#10;&#10;There is little doubt that Kim wants to be popular and loved by his people, and perhaps sincerely cares about the wellbeing of the North Korean populace, though he might have rather eccentric ideas on what constitutes such wellbeing. Under his watch, the North Korean government has spent a significant part of its meagre resources on building all kinds of entertainment facilities, including an elite ski resort, a number of water parks and even a dolphinarium.  &#10;&#10;Kim's North Korea is increasingly a place quite different from the North Korea of his father. It is moving towards a more efficient economy, but also towards more internal repression. It is more prone to erratic changes in domestic policy and more eccentric in many regards. But, of course, for the foreseeable future it is going to remain a nuclear and authoritarian regime, run by the Kim family and a small hereditary elite: This is not negotiable, irrespectively of what the outside world thinks and does.  	Will North Korea change dramatically under the rule of Kim Jong-un?&#10;&#10;

For decades, they had mocked the powerful, the sacred, the dictators, and all those who believed themselves above criticism. These cartoonists felt there was no better way to fight fundamentalism than through derision and laughter. The late Charb, Charlie Hebdo's editor-in-chief, was killed, evoking the words of Spanish republican icon Dolores Ibarruri, who was known to boast: "I'd rather die standing than live kneeling."  &#10;&#10;It is this very impertinence, this freedom to rebel against ideologies, structures and hierarchies through art and literature, that has been targeted. France is known for its triad "liberty, equality, brotherhood" engraved at the helm of every school, on all official buildings. This motto attributed to French theologian and writer Francois Fenelon at the end of the 17th century was popularised during the French Revolution, when popular unrest toppled religious and authoritative powers. This philosophy was central to Charlie Hebdo's editorial line and promoted by Charb, known for his firm leftist stands, and for advocating for more justice and wealth redistribution.  &#10;&#10;Yet, the likely beneficiaries of this heinous act will be the very opponents of this libertarian and humanist stance. A few hours after the events, extreme right leader Marine Le Pen immediately seized the opportunity to unleash her short-sighted Islamophobic attacks. While spontaneous gatherings and demonstrations took place across the country to show the country's grief and support for the victims, Le Pen dissuaded her supporters from participating. She later set conditions for taking part in the Republican march organised for next Sunday.  &#10;&#10;This political move is unsurprising from Le Pen. Her political platform is built upon her populist claims of the threats stemming from Islam and more generally, from immigrants. She built her political success on the rise of communitarianism and the growing rifts and dissent in French society. A solidarity march gathering all religions and all sectors of the population in favour of freedom of the press does not play to her political hand.  &#10;&#10;While the French Muslim authorities have called on every mosque in the country to strongly condemn this act of terrorism and encourage participation in the march, Le Pen would rather continue her own crusade alone and capitalise on growing French fears.  &#10;&#10;She would rather call for "open war on Islam" than demonstrate with the 99.99 percent of French Muslims who respect the Republican law.  &#10;&#10;Her traditional supporters, such as skinhead groups "Riposte Laique" and "Bloc identitaire", have called for a "civil war in the country against Islamisation". But they have failed to mention that Ahmed Merabet, the brave policeman who tried to stop the terrorists and was shot dead in the street, was himself Muslim and defended French Republican values through a lifetime of service in the police force.  &#10;&#10;While traditional parties call for national unity in a peaceful march, Le Pen's supporters blow on the ashes of societal discontent, encouraging retaliation against this act of terrorism. Mosques were reportedly shot at in Le Mans at midnight, a kebab restaurant was bombed in Villefranche. Barbary is answered by stupidity.  &#10;&#10;Ironically, Le Pen will likely benefit from the fears and shock after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo, a magazine that has been one of her strongest opponents. Le Pen can hardly call for the protection of freedom of the press when her own party has regularly tried to limit it by selecting the newspapers and networks who could cover her meetings and ask her questions.  &#10;&#10;Two years ago, her own father vehemently criticised Charlie Hebdo, calling the publication a rag after it ridiculed his political party. Marine Le Pen herself then officially asked for the resignation of any journalist that would show Charlie Hebdo's cover on national TV.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;Similarly, Nicolas Sarkozy is an awkward defender of Charlie Hebdo. First, his strategy to win back the presidency in 2017 is to stress on the inability of Francois Hollande to fill the shoes of president, constantly criticising his lack of authority and charisma.  &#10;&#10;The current terrorist crisis is a defining moment for Hollande who might now well prove his capacity to unite a grieving society. More importantly, Sarkozy can hardly support Charlie Hebdo and freedom of the press when he himself personally demanded the resignation of one of its cartoonists in 2008.  &#10;&#10;At the time Sarkozy was furious that the magazine had published a cartoon mocking his son Jean Sarkozy, whose ambition dwarves the legendary one of his father. Charlie Hebdo described Jean Sarkozy's marriage to a very wealthy Jewish heiress as an attempt to secure his future after failing to finish his university degree. Nicolas Sarkozy managed to obtain the dismissal of the cartoonist Sine and put him on trial for anti-Semitism.  &#10;&#10;Ironically, his colleagues were not so fortunate yesterday when faced with fundamentalists claiming Charlie Hebdo was an enemy of the Muslim prophet.  	Only France's extreme right will profit from the deaths of the satirists who&#10;challenged the establishment.&#10;&#10;
068-defusingtalibanpublicity	aljazeera	Tue, 09 Dec 2014 07:00:10 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/defusing-taliban-publicity-201412665411174700.html	Massoumeh Torfeh	Defusing Taliban publicity	Journalists in Afghanistan have decided for the second time this year to curtail their reporting on Taliban attacks as a means of reducing the impact of their message. The first such collective action was taken during the presidential elections when the Taliban were completely boycotted. This is a strategic decision according to Fahim Dashty, the chief executive of Afghanistan's National Journalists Union (ANJU). The decision follows the recent heavy escalation of attacks in Kabul.  &#10;&#10;"Our media is saturated with images of Taliban attacks," says a joint press statement by ANJU, and the media watchdog, Nai. "Taliban spokesman Zabihula Mujahid is active on TV and social media round the clock, he is in every home 24 hours a day, we need to confront his messages," says Nai's director, Sediqulah Tauhidi.  &#10;&#10;Afghan journalists feel they need support from policy makers and the international community alike.  &#10;&#10;"We will be calling on the new president, Ashraf Ghani, to consider blocking the sites that Taliban use for their publicity," says Dashty.  &#10;&#10;Confronting publicity  &#10;&#10;The call by journalists in Afghanistan echoes international concerns about the need to confront publicity by armed groups such as ISIL, and the attempts in several countries including Britain to block these groups' use of the internet and social media to advertise, publicise and recruit.  &#10;&#10;British Home Secretary Theresa May acknowledged the extent of the problem in her latest policy speech: "We need a counter terrorism strategy that is comprehensive and coherent."  &#10;&#10;Among the measures to curb the activities of the Islamist terror groups she introduced restrictions on the use of the internet.  &#10;&#10;"We are engaged in a struggle that is fought on many fronts," she said, naming terrorist groups in several parts of the world including Afghanistan. Police and intelligence agencies will be given new powers to track down those who plot terrorist attacks over the internet.  &#10;&#10;"They enable the authorities to limit a subject's access to telephones and the internet," she said.  &#10;&#10;Terrorist attacks have been complex but many are used for sending a specific message either to the local population or to the international community. Once these messages are turned into images on TV and internet across the world their impact is amplified.  &#10;&#10;Broader audience  &#10;&#10;According to UN counterterrorism research, terrorist-related propaganda hosted on popular websites containing user-generated content has the potential to reach a significantly broader audience than content on traditional specialised websites, bulletin boards and web forums, which generally appeal to a self- selected group of individuals.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;"Their sophisticated use of the internet and social media means they have a significant propaganda reach across the world," said the British home secretary.  &#10;&#10;"The scourge of ISIL should not mean that the Taliban are forgotten or seen as the milder terror group," stresses Dashty. There are serious reservations when British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond states at the opening of the London Conference on Afghanistan that "The terrorist threat from the region has been substantially reduced," when there are almost daily attacks in Kabul.  &#10;&#10;"Taliban are blocking the fledgling democracy that has been built over the last decade," says Nai director. "They are attacking our liberty, they are targeting freedom of speech, they are targeting press freedom and we must have a counter offensive."  &#10;&#10;Dashty says as journalists we must ask ourselves whether in our endeavour to provide information we are turning into communication channels at the service of the Taliban.  &#10;&#10;The arguments are not straightforward. On the one hand, the media needs to report to inform the population and on the other hand, reporting terrorist attacks has increasingly become publicity for armed extremist groups. On the one hand freedom of speech and civil liberties should be preserved at all cost, and on the other hand, terrorist messages have traumatised societies and increased militant recruitment around the world.  &#10;&#10;Credible counter-narrative  &#10;&#10;These issues must be discussed in depth and collectively around the world. There is a need for coordinating a credible counter narrative both at the local and the global level to confront the banality and cruelty of terrorist messages.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;Take for example their claim, believed even by some analysts, that they are fighting to save Muslims while facts tell us that they have killed tens of thousands over the years. Since 2009, there have been over 17,000 civilian deaths in Afghanistan alone as documented by the UN - 75 percent as a result of Taliban attacks. Or the contradictions in the Taliban claim that they want foreign forces out while targeting British interests one month after British forces left Afghanistan, or inviting foreign Islamist fighters and al-Qaeda to set up camp in Afghanistan during their rule.  &#10;&#10;"Confusion and contradictions among the various terrorist voices" are common according to the latest State Department report on terrorism.  &#10;&#10;Journalists, media analysts, communication experts and policy makers need to come together to discuss how best to build a framework for a new counterterrorism narrative that at the same time reveals the falsities of terrorist assertions. Once formulated, it could then be used as any public service broadcast messages woven into drama serials, discussions, debates and news coverage alike.  &#10;&#10;The UN Office on Drugs and Crime, which created a counterterrorism task force, says that despite increasing international recognition of the threat posed by terrorists' use of the internet, "there is currently no universal instrument specifically addressing this pervasive facet of terrorist activity".  &#10;&#10;'Psychological security'  &#10;&#10;The joint statement by ANJU and Nai calls on the media and the reporters in Afghanistan to refrain from competition over who shows more pictures of the gruesome Taliban attacks. It says that the "unprecedented" frequency of the footage shown on TV and social media have undermined the "psychological security" of the nation.  &#10;&#10;"Our first boycott of the Taliban was successful," says Dashty. "Attacks were reduced and over 60 percent of the population took part in the elections."  &#10;&#10;He says they would really benefit if journalists in the West supported their campaigns, especially those who frequently report from Afghanistan.  &#10;&#10;"We would also welcome an international framework that sets an example for us," says Dashty.  &#10;&#10;A coordinated global plan to counter terrorist media propaganda would be a useful tool for journalists in areas adversely affected by terrorist attacks. Attacks plotted on the World Wide Web need an appropriate worldwide media response.  	Afghan journalists will stop reporting on Taliban attacks - but will this&#10;local effort alone make a difference?&#10;&#10;
069-didcoltranesayallahsupreme	aljazeera	Tue, 09 Dec 2014 07:07:57 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/did-coltrane-say-allah-supreme-201412810939759431.html	Hisham Aidi	Did Coltrane say 'Allah Supreme'?	"A Love Supreme" is widely recognised as John Coltrane's masterwork, and a milestone recording in the history of jazz. Many an aficionado came to jazz through that classic album - a 32-minute-long composition organised around a four-note bass routine. The manuscript for the album is one of the National Museum of American History's treasures; the saxophone that Coltrane used to record the piece was recently gifted to the Smithsonian Museum; and former US President Bill Clinton, a saxophonist and Coltrane fan, is said to have "A Love Supreme" set as the ringtone for when Hillary calls.  &#10;&#10;This week marks the 50th anniversary of "A Love Supreme" . Recorded on December 9, 1964, the composition is being celebrated worldwide in concerts, festivals, academic symposia and even at churches. The Saint John Coltrane African Orthodox Church - founded in 1969 by two clerics who saw Coltrane perform live in the San Francisco, and experienced a "sound baptism" - celebrated "A Love Supreme" mass on December 8, in San Francisco's iconic Grace Cathedral.  &#10;&#10;The recording has long been understood to be a deeply spiritual, even devotional, piece. Its four phases - "Acknowledgement", "Resolution", "Pursuance" and "Psalms" - reflect what Coltrane described as a "spiritual awakening" in his overcoming of drug and alcohol problems.  &#10;&#10;All praise belongs to God  &#10;&#10;Yet, what was the nature of that "spiritual awakening"? The conventional view is that by 1964, Coltrane had moved away from his Methodist upbringing, adopting a "pan-religious" outlook with a particular interest in Eastern mysticism. In spite of that, "A Love Supreme" is still described as laden with Biblical symbolism: the title "Psalm", and the rising cadences, reminiscent of black preachers' style, are offered as evidence that Coltrane was still rooted in Christianity. But ask one of the jazzmen or Muslim elders who knew Coltrane, and you get a different answer.  &#10;&#10;The saxophonist Yusef Lateef, who died at the age of 93 earlier this year, worked closely with Coltrane between 1963 and 1966. In his autobiography , "A Gentle Giant", Lateef says: "The prayer that John wrote in 'A Love Supreme' repeats the phrase 'All praise belongs to God no matter what' several times. This phrase has the semantics of the al-Fatiha, which is the first chapter or sura of the Holy Quran. The Arabic transliteration is 'al-Humdulilah…' Since all faithful Muslims say the al-Fatiha five times a day or more, it is reasonable to assume that John heard this phrase from [his Muslim wife] Sister Naima many times."  &#10;&#10;Lateef is referring to the poem Coltrane wrote and included in the liner notes of the album. Coltrane wrote: "No matter what … It is with God. He is gracious and merciful" and ends with "All praise to God..."  &#10;&#10;What Lateef and others have noted is that "gracious and merciful" is a translation of "rahman raheem", the opening lines of the Fatiha. Moreover, say the elders, when Coltrane begins chanting the album's title for half a minute it sounds like a Sufi breathily repeating "Allah supreme".  &#10;&#10;The relationship between Islam and jazz is almost a century-old. It was in the 1920s that the Ahmadiyya movement, a heterodox Islamic movement that emerged in 19th century India, began sending missionaries to US cities, building a substantial following among African Americans in the decades to come. In a trend that still intrigues historians and music critics, after World War II, scores of jazz musicians embraced Ahmadi Islam.  &#10;&#10;When Coltrane arrived in Philadelphia in 1943, the Muslim presence in the "city of brotherly love" would rattle the young man. As he told an interviewer in 1958: "This Muslim thing came up. I got introduced to that. And that kind of shook me."  &#10;&#10;Ongoing debate in Philadelphia  &#10;&#10;The saxophonist was surrounded by Muslims: his drummer Rashied Ali was Muslim, as was his pianist McCoy Tyner (Suleiman Saud), and saxophonist Lateef. Coltrane then married Naima Grubbs, an observant Muslim. Even Coltrane's band members have pondered his relationship to Islam. If Lateef suspected that Coltrane's art was influenced by the Quran, the drummer Rashied Ali thought that the saxophonist was "a real country boy" and that "he was into being a Muslim and everything like that".  &#10;&#10;"Back then jazz and Islam were intertwined - the first time I heard the adhan on Temple University radio, I thought it was a Nina Simone song," says Imam Nadim Ali, a celebrated jazz deejay and community leader who spent his youth in Philadelphia. "Artists were deeply influenced by Islam - sometimes publicly in their art, sometimes privately."  &#10;&#10;It's not inconceivable that "A Love Supreme" could have been inspired by the Quran. After all, as the elders will observe, "Celebration", that great funk hit by Kool & the Gang, was inspired by a Quranic sura.  &#10;&#10;"The initial idea came from the Quran," says Ronald Bell (Khalis Bayyan), the group's saxophonist and musical arranger. "I was reading the passage, where God was creating Adam, and the angels were celebrating and singing praises. That inspired me to write the basic chords, the line, 'Everyone around the world, come on, celebration'."  &#10;&#10;This song inspired by Islam - and released in 1980 - would become an international hit heard at ball games and political rallies in the US, and ironically was played by the Reagan administration on February 7, 1981, to welcome home the hostages held by students in the Islamic Republic of Iran.  &#10;&#10;One also hears the argument that Coltrane wanted to title his composition "Allah Supreme" - instead of "A Love Supreme" - but was worried about a political backlash, given the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. The mass conversion of African Americans to Islam unsettled many European Americans and tensions rippled into the jazz world. Jazz critics would often dismiss the converts as "strange" and "confused".  &#10;&#10;Young converts  &#10;&#10;In his memoir, Dizzy Gillespie candidly describes the pressures that faced young converts in the jazz world.  &#10;&#10;"The movement among jazz musicians towards Islam created quite a stir, especially with the surge of the Zionist movement," writes Dizzy Gillespie in "To Be or Not to Bop". "A lot of friction arose between Jews and Muslims, which took the form of a semi-boycott in New York of jazz musicians with Muslim names… Near the end of the '40s, the newspapers really got worried about whether I'd convert to Islam."  &#10;&#10;Gillespie was, as he would say, "intrigued" by "the beautiful sound of the word Quran and discussed Islam extensively with Lateef. But in 1948, in a shoot for a feature story with Life magazine, Gillespie was asked to pose shirtless, cross-legged, and bowing with his arms outstretched. The magazine published the piece and claimed (falsely) that the trumpeter was bowing in prayer towards Mecca. The media ruckus that ensued about the King of Bebop's abandonment of Christianity incensed Gillespie. He would eventually become a Bahai."  &#10;&#10;Political and racial pressures still bear heavily on black and Muslim artists (especially hip hop artists) today. And we may never know what Coltrane had in mind when he composed his masterpiece. But as the US celebrates and and tries to mainstream figures from the turbulent 1960s, voices from the communities that produced the likes of Coltrane, Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali, should be heard - especially as the domestic and foreign policies that pushed African Americans towards Islam a century ago are still with us.  &#10;&#10;Hisham Aidi teaches at Columbia University. He is the author of the critically acclaimed Rebel Music: Race, Empire and the New Muslim Youth Culture, a study of black internationalism and global youth culture.  	Fifty years after John Coltrane's death, the debate about the religious nature&#10;of his music rages on.&#10;&#10;
070-diversityamongpoliceofficersis	guardian	2015-01-20T15:17:12Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/20/diversity-among-police-officers-is-key-but-it-wont-solve-the-problems-with-policing	Ronald Weitzer	Diversity among police officers is key, but it won't solve the problems with policing	In Ferguson, Missouri, 50 of the 53 police officers are white in a city that is two-thirds African American. In Connecticut’s state capital, Hartford, 66% of the police department is white but only 16% of the residents are. And these are just two examples: despite progress over the past 50 years, many police departments remain predominantly white in cities and towns where the majority of the population is nonwhite.  &#10;&#10;There are some important exceptions to the disparity pattern. Several big city police departments are majority-black or majority-Hispanic (Atlanta, Birmingham, Detroit, Washington, Miami, Santa Fe and El Paso, for instance), while others (such as Chicago) are so diverse that no single group comprises the majority. Yet for many other cities, the gap between the complexion of the police department and the local population is huge.  &#10;&#10;Why does this matter? Do police officers of different racial and ethnic backgrounds act differently while on the job? Do they have different kinds of relationships with minority communities? Aren’t all officers trained to do their jobs similarly and to treat all civilians the same regardless of race?  &#10;&#10;Research shows that, in general in the US, there is not a strong correlation, let alone a causal relationship, between an officer’s race and how officers treat members of the public when they respond to calls from civilians or stop and question them on the streets Statistics are, of course, not predictive of individual behavior, and studies of specific departments or communities vary. A 2004 study in Indianapolis (Indiana) and St. Petersburg (Florida) by Ivan Sun and Brian Payne, for example, found that black officers were more likely than white officers working in black neighborhoods to provide information, referrals to other agencies, and to treat residents respectfully, although the black officers were also more likely to use physical force against citizens in conflict situations. But, again, most studies find similarities overall in police behavior irrespective of officers’ racial background.  &#10;&#10;Shared training in the academy, as well as on-the-job socialization by fellow officers, results in more similarities than differences among officers when it comes to their policing activities, including similarities in how officers of all races treat white versus non-white citizens. So we should not view racial diversification on the force as a panacea for improving police treatment of minorities: instead if minority officers adopt majority attitudes about those they serve and protect, it might hardly help at all. A 2008 study in Baltimore, Maryland by Peter Moskos documented precisely this shared mentality among both white and black officers.  &#10;&#10;But it can pay major dividends in other ways. In one poll of 1,791 Americans that I and a colleague conducted for our book, Race and Policing in America, more than 70% of blacks, Hispanics and whites in the United States believed that a city’s police department should have a similar racial composition to the city. The same study found that very few blacks and Hispanics (only 5%) want most officers who work in their neighborhoods to be exclusively of the same race as the residents, and instead most people prefer to see racially- mixed teams of officers patrolling their streets. . Importantly, such diversity can help to build trust and confidence in the police: the more a police department reflects the composition of the local population, the higher the department’s reputation among residents, which can provide a foundation to build further trust, coupled with other needed reforms. It also helps, in majority-black or majority-Hispanic cities, if the chief of police comes from that community as well because, as the public face of the department, he or she can allay suspicions when controversial incidents occur in a way that white police chiefs may not be able to do.  &#10;&#10;A diverse police force can also help to decrease the sense that individuals are being stopped and questioned solely because of their race. This clearly applies when the officers and citizens are of the same race, but even encounters between white officers and minority citizens may be perceived as less racialized when the department has a critical mass of minority officers. A representative police force can, in other words, have symbolic benefits that enhance the overall status of a police department and also reduce the perception that actions, such as stops or searches, are based on racial profiling.  &#10;&#10;Most police chiefs realize the advantages of a department that represents the local community, but there are big challenges in recruiting more minority officers. Many Hispanics and African Americans are reluctant to consider a career in law enforcement – not surprising, given the history of policing in America coupled with more recent events. Highly-publicized incidents like the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson and Eric Garner in New York only make it more difficult for police departments to recruit minority officers.  &#10;&#10;Recruiters can have some success, however, if they broaden their outreach efforts to include churches and community centers – and if there are pre- existing positive relationships between the police and residents in those minority neighborhoods where community policing has already taken root, which can be built on. Although troubled interactions between minorities and police garner most of the headlines, there are neighborhoods in American cities where working-class and middle-class black and Hispanic residents – including youths – have better relationships with the authorities than on average, as I found in a study of Washington DC neighborhoods. It is in these communities that the police can enhance their recruitment efforts and achieve at least some success.  &#10;&#10;Racial diversification is one crucial ingredient in a larger program of reform that is required to improve police departments throughout the country. A representative police force is not a panacea – but it is a positive reform, and an achievable one.  	Ronald Weitzer: Shared training and on-the-job socialization results in many similarities among officers regardless of race – including in how they treat non-white citizens
071-doeseuroperemembergenevacon	aljazeera	Thu, 18 Dec 2014 12:18:25 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/does-europe-remember-geneva-con-201412189019976228.html	Flaminia Giambalvo	Does Europe remember the Geneva Convention?	"A few months ago someone starved to death in our squat," said Muna a 26-year- old Somali woman who has been living inside a run-down university building in Rome since 2006. Selam Palace, where over 1,000 refugees live, has become the symbol of Italy's "migration crisis". Like Muna, thousands of the country's refugees are living in unofficial housing arrangements including tent cities, old factories, dumpsters even henhouses.  &#10;&#10;They are the lucky ones; the ones who made it. "I saw my brother drown in front of my eyes," said Hamid who survived the shipwreck during which 10 people died. "I had to leave him behind; it would have been too difficult for my mother to lose both her sons on the same night" he added.  &#10;&#10;Authorities say they lack the resources to adequately support migrants, but those working on the ground argue that repressive border practices and ineffective policies are to blame. In Sicily, asylum seekers have been housed inside churches, gyms and abandoned schools, often in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions.  &#10;&#10;Fights have become frequent inside these centres where migrants are abandoned for months, even years, with very little idea of what is happening to them. "The south of Italy is becoming a concentration camp for migrants," said MS Cordaro as we drove past the CARA Mineo, a processing centre for migrants, which currently holds over 4,000 people.  &#10;&#10;Stuck between EU regulations, which force them to claim asylum in their first port of call, and the inefficiencies of Italian bureaucracy, many migrants in Italy end up in a limbo of illegality and destitution. On my first day in Sicily I met Adeel, a 26-year-old Pakistani man who lives in a shanty town just outside a processing centre, with 200 other asylum seekers.  &#10;&#10;"The centre is full and the waiting lists seem to never end, so some people began to set up camp underneath a bridge in its proximity," he said. On the night I was supposed to visit the make shift centre it was cleared by police bulldozers. "Come back in two weeks' time," said Adeel over the phone. "Every so often they do that because they say the camp is illegal. But we just build it again, where else can we go?"  &#10;&#10;However the problem is not just the number of arrivals, but the mismanagement of the asylum system. "Year on year the government declares a state of emergency to deal with immigration," said Manuela Scebba who works for the NGO Arci Amari. "The problem is that there isn't a plan. The wars are not going to stop. What are we going to do next year? Call another emergency?" she adds.  &#10;&#10;"The EU is progressively closing its borders, moving them further south along the Mediterranean," says Carmen Cordaro a lawyer who specialises in maritime border policy. "In this context, the debate over search and rescue missions is almost futile. What we really need is an EU policy on migration that goes beyond surveillance and push-backs, which at the moment is virtually non- existent."  &#10;&#10;In a bid to contain the flow of migrants, EU border-states have traditionally made agreements with neighbouring countries, which do not share their onerous duties towards upholding the human rights of asylum seekers, enshrined in the Geneva Convention.  &#10;&#10;Despite being in contravention of national and international laws, several EU countries have used push-backs as a means of border control. The Spanish Guardia Civil (national law enforcement agency) has often been criticised for handing over migrants to Morocco and there are numerous reports of mass expulsions from Greece to Turkey.  &#10;&#10;"In Europe there seems to be a concerted effort to evade the Geneva Convention. Why doesn't the EU just come out and say it: We no longer want to abide by the Geneva Convention," Cordaro said.  &#10;&#10;There are virtually no legal entry routes into Europe; even for asylum seekers fleeing from war-torn countries like Syria. Far from countering migration flows this approach to migration has merely fuelled the human smuggling market and splintered migration routes towards longer and more dangerous points of passage.  &#10;&#10;Earlier this year I travelled across Italy to document the stories of those who arrive to Italy's borders. "Europe or Die", the name of the documentary, refers to a phrase which a group of men screamed at the producer as they plunged towards the 3m barbwire fence which separates Spain from Morocco.  &#10;&#10;For the past 10 years Italy has declared a "state of emergency" in relation to migration nearly every year. In the meantime, the human rights of migrants have been increasingly sidelined in favour of quick-fix solutions to the "crisis" and tighter border controls. Far from an emergency, the influxes, the deaths and the overcrowding of centres are the predictable consequences of denying a legal entry route to those who have no other choice but to flee.  	European Union countries continue to opt for reactionary crisis management of&#10;migration in the face of human tragedy.&#10;&#10;
072-doreallyneedtocancelchristmas	foxnews	2014-12-05T16:59:58Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/12/05/do-really-need-to-cancel-christmas/	Jeannie Cunnion 	Do we really need to cancel Christmas?	  &#10;&#10;It’s wonderful (and a good thing) to see the new emphasis on “giving over receiving” at Christmas time. It’s become a trend this year with so many families because as parents we want to teach kids about generosity.  &#10;&#10;Moms and dads everywhere are using Christmas as an opportunity to get their kids thinking about serving others and giving to the less fortunate, rather than encouraging them to create monstrous Christmas lists describing all the things they want this season.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Some parents are even “cancelling" Christmas for their kids, not giving any family members any gifts.  &#10;&#10;But do we really need to cancel Christmas in order to foster a spirit of generosity in our kids?  &#10;&#10;Wednesday I joined Lisa Henderson on “Fox & Friends” to debate this very question.  &#10;&#10;Lisa has “cancelled Christmas” in her Utah home because, she says, her kids have become too entitled, “acting so ungrateful” and “extremely disrespectful.”  &#10;&#10;So there will be no presents for Christmas, but, as she writes on her blog Overthebigmooon.com, “There is a good possibility that Santa will be writing them a letter of how proud of them he is and perhaps put a few pieces of hard candy and an orange in their stockings.”  &#10;&#10;While I have great respect for what Lisa wants to accomplish, I disagree with her approach. Christmas should begin, not end, at home.  &#10;&#10;We are already under immense pressure to purge Christmas from our culture. First nativity scenes in public places were under attack, now it’s Christmas trees. Even saying “Merry Christmas” has taken a back seat to “Happy Holidays.”  &#10;&#10;Cancelling Christmas and using letters from Santa to motivate our kids to be generous is not the answer. The answer is in putting the emphasis on the miracle not the material.  &#10;&#10;And here’s the good news. Even our gift giving can point to the miracle.  &#10;&#10;So, yes, we give a few gifts to our kids. But we also give many gifts to the less fortunate.  &#10;&#10;For example, we’ve taught our own kids that the gifts we give them at Christmas aren’t based on whether they’ve been bad or good all year. The gifts we give them are free, unearned, underserved gifts, just like the gift of Jesus is a free, unearned, and underserved gift. This is a very tangible, concrete concept for kids to grasp.  &#10;&#10;And when we serve and give to others, we teach our kids what Jesus said in Matthew 25:40: “Whatever you do for the least of your brothers and sisters, you do for me.”  &#10;&#10;So we give gifts to Jesus on his “birthday” by serving and loving and giving to others!  &#10;&#10;This is how parents can infuse real meaning into Christmas -- not by refusing to celebrate it all together.  &#10;&#10;Cancelling Christmas is simply not the key to fostering generosity in our kids. The key to fostering generosity in our kids is by making giving something we do all year round. By making it a lifestyle.  &#10;&#10;And a lifestyle of giving springs from a deep well of gratitude for how Jesus first gave his life for us.  &#10;&#10;We have to be so careful not to teach our kids that Christmas is about doing more, trying harder, and being better to be worthy of gifts.  &#10;&#10;Christmas is about anticipating and celebrating the greatest gift that has already been given -- the unconditional love of God in the birth of Jesus Christ.  &#10;&#10;Our focus shouldn’t be on whether or not we have a tree overflowing with gifts, but on whether we have a home overflowing with love. His love.  &#10;&#10;And if that’s our starting place, we have a pretty good shot at getting Christmas, and all the 364 other days of the year, right.  	Some parents are even “cancelling Christmas” for their kids, not giving any&#10;family members any gifts. But do we really need to cancel Christmas in order&#10;to foster a spirit of generosity in our kids?&#10;&#10;
073-edsheeransexlessvanillafemalep	guardian	2015-01-18T00:03:33Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/18/ed-sheeran-sexless-vanilla-female-pop-stars-raunchy	Barbara Ellen	Simper while you sing. The ghastly Ed Sheeran effect	Looking at what’s seriously wrong with the world today, it definitely isn’t Ed Sheeran. However, looking at what’s wrong with British music today, it almost definitely is Ed Sheeran.  &#10;&#10;When the Brit nominations were recently announced, much of the focus was rightly on how “white” they were, similar to the Oscars. However, for me, this was not the only reason why the Brit nominations were unsettling. I was also disturbed by the fact that Ed received multiple nominations, including best album and solo artist. I know it’s only the Brits, but come on people – how far do we intend to go with this?  &#10;&#10;I’m no musical snob. I dislike pomposity about mainstream musical tastes. I even think The X Factor is a hoot, and have written on how it’s more colour blind than other parts of the entertainment industry (a point reinforced by the recent nominations).  &#10;&#10;My stance has always been: calm down, there’s room for everybody, right?  &#10;&#10;However, it’s as though Ed Sheeran has gone from being an artist to a syndrome, an effect, even a pox, and he/it is everywhere. There Ed is, performing on television shows, peddling his simpering vanilla-sound. At the Victoria’s Secret fashion show, giggling at the ladies in bras like the last boy-virgin standing at freshers’ week.  &#10;&#10;Ed, whose whiny music makes him sound as though he’s got his tongue permanently trapped in a child safety gate. Who looks as though you’d get up close and he’d smell of Violet Bloom Febreze. Whose lukewarm monotones I fervently feel should be banned in cars, lest motorists are overcome with ennui and fatally fall asleep at the wheel.  &#10;&#10;The other odd thing is that Ed, with his inane grin and funky waistcoats, is completely sexless – exuding all the carnal charisma of a pyjama case.  &#10;&#10;Sam Smith (another multiple Brit nominee) isn’t much better, though he gets extra points for being gay, and being able to sing, instead of doing what Ed does – whimpering like a dog thrown down a well. Is being unthreatening the point of Ed? That he’s a good musical starter-crush for little girls who might find One Direction too frightening? If so, where’s the gender parity? How come the likes of Sheeran are rewarded for being undersexualised while most of the women in his industry are oversexualised – some because they want to be, others because they are told to, but all of them aware that the pressure is on.  &#10;&#10;While there are always exceptions, everyone knows that females are more likely to be coerced into using their sexuality. What’s interesting is that now there’s this corresponding bizarre inversion with males getting less and less sexy – until finally we arrive at the industry “norm” of Sheeran, a parentally approved pop boy-dolly, who comes with guitar accessories, and makes nice soothing noises when you pull a string in his back.  &#10;&#10;Some might say it’s what the audience demands, but isn’t it more about being told what to want? It seems unlikely that the same audience digging Ed’s mellow vibe are demanding that equivalent female artists appear scantily clad, hellbent on fellating the microphone. Do we truly believe that people sit at home saying: “Well, I’m not listening to this – she’s got all her clothes on and hasn’t once pretended to orgasm,”?  &#10;&#10;In short, does it occur to anyone that Sheeran’s banality, the very fact that he’s permitted to be so banal, is a profoundly chauvinist fact in itself? Will we ever see a day when women would be rewarded for being as unsexy as Ed? What about all the Eds he’s inspiring, who are waiting in the wings – will it ever end? Ed Sheeran might be the nicest guy in the world, but it’s time that “Ed Sheeran”, the effect and the pox, was identified and stopped.  &#10;&#10;Without meaning to be alarmist, I fear that there may be a royal clothes shortage. Kate, duchess of Cambridge, has always been congratulated for wearing (and re-wearing) high-street fashion. Since becoming pregnant, she’s won yet more plaudits for wearing non-maternity items.  &#10;&#10;The whole thing has become overdone to the point where one could become seriously concerned that the duchess might not have enough clothes. A national embarrassment. We can’t have our queen-to-be scrabbling around for some decent threads.  &#10;&#10;Perhaps we should all rifle through our wardrobes and donate something. I’ve got a couple of bits she could have – the hems have come down, and I’m not sure if she’s into “vintage ASOS”, huge flower prints or suspicious stains, but in her situation she can’t afford to be too picky. I also need to know Kate’s shoe size – it seems only fair that the gesture is reciprocated, and I’m wondering if she has any furry Crocs I could borrow for the spring season?  &#10;&#10;Obviously I’m being facetious, but does the duchess really have to be congratulated for doing what every woman does – which is to wear her clothes more than once?  &#10;&#10;Google Glass (the “smart” eyewear that made Joe Bloggs resemble Joe 90) is being phased out. The focus will now be on future versions of Glass, with the company feeling that the project “allowed us to learn what’s important to consumers and enterprises alike”. Which appears to be corporate-speak for: “We belatedly realised that everyone felt like complete berks wearing them.”  &#10;&#10;I don’t pretend to be cutting-edge in any way. I’m one of life’s late adopters, which means that I watch other people go through teething problems with new technology while I stand on the sidelines looking gormless, occasionally jeering and feeling vindicated when things go wrong. Like now, for instance. It’s not pretty, but it works for me.  &#10;&#10;With Google Glass, I didn’t have long to wait. Even I could see that specs- with-screens was a non-starter and that the Nathan Barley-esque marketing line: “Your chance to walk down the high street, watching pointless stuff with one eye while looking like a prize tit” was never going to be a winner with the masses.  &#10;&#10;Commiserations to those who spent close to £1,000 on the wearable tech, produced under the Explorer programme, expecting it to develop further. I would tell them not to be bitter; they should feel proud of their early adopting ways. Many moons ago, there would have been people investing in inventors who wanted to fly, who ran about fields flapping big fake wings, before presumably being gently escorted to a nearby asylum. In time, this led to aeroplanes. Thus Google Glass purchasers can at least have the satisfaction of knowing that they were pioneers – the flint that created the spark that lit the fire. Or whatever analogy tech mugs prefer to make them feel better about being a grand lighter.

074-educationpathfinancialsecurity	guardian	2015-01-09T17:57:35Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/09/education-path-financial-security-student-loan-bill	Anthonia Akitunde	An education was my path to financial security. Then I got my student loan bill	I have a very distinct memory from my first day of college: My family’s minivan slowly pulling into my dormitory’s parking lot, through a crowd of first-year students flanked by helicopter parents and, in retrospect, probably hungover orientation week advisers. I remember thinking “Hurry up! I’m ready to start my real life.”  &#10;&#10;I had no idea what I was really rushing towards.  &#10;&#10;As the only daughter of Nigerian immigrants with a tenuous-at-best toehold on the middle class, college was billed as the only path to financial security. “No one can ever take away your education,” my father would say repeatedly. While that may be true, two degrees later someone could take away my access to decent housing because of my shit credit, thanks to the nearly $60,000 in student loans I’ve essentially defaulted on since graduating from the University of Chicago and Northwestern University.  &#10;&#10;It seems a college education is part of the American dream that’s easy to buy (or borrow) into, but hard to pay off.  &#10;&#10;With tuition soaring, and the middle class shrinking along with their incomes, many students and their families are left holding incredibly expensive bags. In 2013, 69% of graduating seniors at public and private nonprofit colleges took out student loans to pay for college, and “about one-fifth of new graduates’ debt was in private loans,” according to the Project on Student Debt. Even public schools – long considered a more affordable option – are less accessible: public colleges increasingly rely on tuition dollars as state funding continues to fall (25% and 23%, respectively, in 2012, compared to 17% and 23% in 2003). The country’s cumulative student loan debt ($1.1tn) has surpassed car loans ($875bn) and credit card debt ($659bn). Though college graduates make more than their peers who only graduated from high school, for many, monthly student loans leach into that extra $17,500 in salary.  &#10;&#10;Yet the party line that college education is the middle class’ only hope for upward mobility persists – it will even be the message of President Obama’s last stop on his “SOTU Spoiler” tour in Knoxville, Tennessee.  &#10;&#10;“In today’s economy,” Dan Pfeiffer, the president’s senior advisor, wrote on Medium, “access to a college education is the surest ticket to the middle class — and the President’s proposals will help more young people punch that ticket.”  &#10;&#10;One of those proposals is to make student loans affordable and assign values to colleges based on their affordability, access and “outcomes” – such as whether or not people graduate and enter high-paying jobs or go on to get graduate degrees. These changes will perhaps make starry-eyed students less easily swayed than I was by the promise of reading Plato on the quad. Another is making the first two years of community college free for “anybody who’s willing to work for it,” as the President announced in a preview video on Thursday. A step in the right direction, but one that needs backing from a Republican Congress to happen. Without it, we’re back at square one: Graduates and incoming students signing up for the decades-long financial burden taking out student loans to fund your education all but ensures. (President Obama should know—he and the First Lady didn’t pay off their student loans until they were in their 40s.)  &#10;&#10;As someone who punched that ticket twice, I’m still waiting for my express bus to the middle class. The modest income I make as an entrepreneur with a day job is whittled away each month thanks to loan payments (plus interest) to various financial intuitions that feel more like bounty hunters than supporters of middle-class aspirants.  &#10;&#10;With that $60,000 in student loans hanging over me, I’m still waiting to start the “real” life I’d always imagined for myself. It’s just that now I want one with its possibilities a little less hampered by student debt.

075-eeocschoolwrongtofireteacherwh	foxnews	2015-01-07T05:00:40Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/01/07/eeoc-school-wrong-to-fire-teacher-who-gave-bible-to-student/	Todd Starnes	EEOC: School wrong to fire teacher who gave Bible to student	  &#10;&#10;A New Jersey school district violated the law when it fired a teacher who handed a Bible to a student, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruled on December 15, 2014. The ruling was made public Tuesday.  &#10;&#10;The EEOC determined there was reasonable cause to believe the Phillipsburg School District discriminated against Walt Tutka, a substitute teacher. The EEOC also said religion and retaliation played a factor in Tutka’s firing.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;“This is a great indication the EEOC is taking religious liberty seriously and they are going to enforce the law — and in this case make sure Walt’s rights are protected,” Liberty Institute attorney Hiram Sasser told me.  &#10;&#10;Liberty Institute is a law firm that specializes in religious liberty cases.  &#10;&#10;“This sends a message to school districts that their natural allergic reaction to religion is misplaced, and not only is it wrong — but it’s also an egregious violation of the law,” Sasser said.  &#10;&#10;As I first reported, Tutka was working as a substitute teacher on Oct. 12, 2013, when he ran afoul of school policies. He told a straggling student at the end of a line, “The first shall be last and the last shall be first.”  &#10;&#10;The student asked on a number of occasions where the line was from, and Tutka told him it was from the Bible. When he discovered the child did not have a Bible, Tutka gave him his personal copy. It was not all that unusual because Tutka is a member of Gideons International, a ministry known for providing Bibles to school children across the world.  &#10;&#10;On Oct. 18, Tutka was summoned to the principal’s office, where he was accused of violating a school policy that bans the distribution of religious materials and another that directs teachers to be neutral when discussion religious material.  &#10;&#10;He was fired on Jan. 14.  &#10;&#10;Sasser said he hopes the school district will reinstate Tutka.  &#10;&#10;“If they don’t do the right thing, they will face some serious consequences,” he told me. “They are going to be liable for damages.”  &#10;&#10;I reached out to George Chando, the superintendent of the Phillipsburg School District. He declined to return my call.  &#10;&#10;My advice to him is to do the right thing, or Liberty Institute will go after him like a pit bull going after a pork chop.  &#10;&#10;Sasser said the EEOC ruling should serve as a warning to other school districts around the nation.  &#10;&#10;“You can’t just fire people because they happen to hand a Bible to somebody while they are at work,” he said.  &#10;&#10;Sasser said he believes the school district was out to get Walt because he is a Gideon. I obtained a copy of an email from Phillipsburg Middle School Assistant Principal John Stillo that suggest the school district had an issue with the well-known religious group.  &#10;&#10;“It has been brought to the administration’s attention that Gideons may be near our campus to distribute literature to our students,” Stillo wrote in a memo to the school’s staff. “Please make sure they DO NOT step foot onto our campus at any time. There will be added police and security presence at dismissal.”  &#10;&#10;Gideon International has a long history of providing Bibles to public school students, but many districts have banned the religious society in recent years. Ironically, the Gideons are welcome to distribute Bibles and deliver speeches in Russian schools.  &#10;&#10;The Phillipsburg School District should rehire Walt. And it owes him a big apology. They waged a disgusting public war against this fine, upstanding man simply because he gave a child a Bible. Shame on you, Phillipsburg School District. Shame on you.

For just A$9.99 (£5), you can reduce grown men to fairy princesses and provide your frenemies with hours of vacuuming fun. For years, your victim will find specks of glitter everywhere they go. They will serve as ineradicable sparkles of your vengeance. Best of all, you will be able to exert great power without feeling great responsibility. I mean, it’s glitter, right? Who can stay mad at glitter?  &#10;&#10;But don’t get too excited: ShipYourEnemiesGlitter.com has become a victim of its own success. The site launched on Monday and then crashed within hours because of the level of demand. It seems there are an awful lot of people out there who have been waiting all their lives for a site offering glitter-based revenge with international delivery options. At the time of writing, the website was back up, but all services were temporarily suspended because “you guys have a sick fascination with shipping people glitter”.  &#10;&#10;So disappointing. What is an ethical avenger to do now? Don’t worry, while our Australian friends get their glitter game back on track, here are some other ways you can be kind to be cruel.  &#10;&#10;This is pretty much the glitter trick, just with lifestyle advice. At first your nemesis will be thrilled that you have signed them up to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow’s blog and email newsletter. They’ll discover food allergies they never knew they had! They’ll learn how to crochet quinoa! Soon, however, the interminable emails will become a nuisance. Your nemesis will decide they’ve had enough. But no matter how many times they hit that unsubscribe button, they will find trying to consciously uncouple from the site to be nigh impossible. Somewhere deep inside their soul, like a speck of glitter on otherwise spotless cashmere carpet, Gwyneth will be present, and she will be judging.  &#10;&#10;As Marx would have said if he’d ever come across a Starbucks: caffeine is the amphetamine of the people. It can traumatise the body and wreak havoc on the soul. You can read more in-depth reporting about this in this excellent Goop post: “Foods that cause pain.” So save your caffeine-dependent foes from themselves via this simple but powerful caffeine trick. Their adrenal glands will thank you for it. Their sanity won’t.  &#10;&#10;Gosh! You tell your selfie-obsessed frenemy. You have the sort of face that could grace a thousand articles, advertisements, and corporate websites. Have you ever thought of a career as a stock photography model? Having planted this lucrative seed in your narcissist-nemesis’s mind, sit back and watch as their mugshots take on a life of their own. Perhaps the Guardian will use their photo to illustrate an advice column headlined “I fantasise about group sex with old, obese men”. Or maybe they will pop up, nestling a watermelon and a gun, in a Buzzfeed listicle of unexplainable stock photos. The possibilities are endless.  &#10;&#10;A supposedly fun thing they will never do again.  &#10;&#10;This revenge-hack kills two annoying birds with one stone by using the power of niche dating websites to find your nemesis the love they so richly deserve. If they like bad boys, I suggest meet-an-inmate.com. If they find sharing difficult, then connect them with an Ayn Rand enthusiast over at The Atlasphere. Or just find them a Sea Captain Date in the hope that you’ll never have to see them again. There’s something for everyone online!  &#10;&#10;This is one of the most egregiously irritating things you can do to a person in the 21st century.  &#10;&#10;But make sure they are also slightly passive-aggressive. “Silence does not always mark wisdom,” said Samuel Taylor Coleridge. “Every artist was first an amateur,” said Ralph Waldo Emerson. The recipient will feel motivated, but also slightly denigrated.  &#10;&#10;This is a long-term play that requires you discovering some sort of unpleasant fact that you can then prove with equations and name after someone you dislike. However, assuming you can do all the above, you will be rewarded via the Third Law of Spiteful Science: a body, once immortalised by science, will feel grateful for this afterlife, yet mortified by their legacy. Take Murphy, for example, forever associated with the idea that anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. Not to mention Pavlov’s poor dog, whose psychic secretions will never be forgotten.  &#10;&#10;The above examples are for illustrative purposes only: please do not try any of these at home. Specifically, if I find myself suddenly signed up to any Goop newsletters I will respond swiftly and with glitter.  	Arwa Mahdawi: Though a sellout in Oz, shipping glitter-bombs to enemies is a bit tame. How about signing them up to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop?

Dear Eric,  &#10;&#10;Walaikum salam warahmatullahi wabarakatuhu.  &#10;&#10;Serious question. Will you be sending a letter any time soon to members of the Roman Catholic church following the child-abuse scandals in Catholic institutions? Or a letter to the Board of Deputies of British Jews on the subject of illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank?  &#10;&#10;No?  &#10;&#10;Thought as much.  &#10;&#10;Ten years on from 9/11 and you’re still asking the same questions, questions that have proved worse than useless in the intervening years. Still wondering aloud about the loyalty of British citizens based on their spiritual beliefs. Still demanding that these people prove themselves compatible with the “British way of life”, as defined by you.  &#10;&#10;In your letter this week, you say that you “know acts of extremism are not representative of Islam”. You mention that “British values are Muslim values”. Yet you insist on asking us to speak to our young people, telling them that “extremists have nothing to offer them”. Do you really think that little of our young people? That they can’t tell the difference between right and wrong? Do you imagine that they are already that different, that set apart from British society, simply because they’re Muslim? Do you think that little of our ability to bring them up to know that taking life is a sin?  &#10;&#10;To accept the terms of your argument for a moment, we already know that 83% of Muslims living in the UK say they identify with British values. Others are as free not to identify with them as any non-Muslim might be – the right to be disaffected isn’t limited to Christians. That a tiny number of Muslims are also lost to violent extremism says as much about other members of our faith as the conduct of abusers in the Catholic church does about theirs. But still you require our religious leaders do more in “demonstrating how faith in Islam can be part of British identity”.  &#10;&#10;Rather than send a patronising letter telling Muslim leaders what to do, maybe you should actually sit down with Muslim leaders and listen to them, really listen. You’ve been in the job for nearly five years. They would tell you that since 9/11 we have condemned, apologised and worked tirelessly to expose the incompatibility of the terrorists’ ideology with Islam. We have done what you have asked us to do. But we are like any other citizens of the UK today. We are anxious. Anxious about an increase in intolerance towards minorities, including but not limited to our own. Anxious about the economy. Anxious about whether the NHS can continue to meet our needs. Anxious about whether our children will be able to afford higher education. In general, it seems our fears are not listened to.  &#10;&#10;You are communities secretary. You have a duty of care to the diverse peoples who make up Britain and define British values. Sadly, it seems the only time you engage with us is under the rubric of counter-terrorism. With attacks against Muslims taking place across the country, more than ever before we need your reassurance and protection.  &#10;&#10;Instead we get a letter suggesting we’re not doing enough.  &#10;&#10;I would say it’s you, communities secretary, who hasn’t done nearly enough. I’m afraid your letter will be received respectfully, but with disappointment, up and down the country.  &#10;&#10;Yours sincerely,  &#10;&#10;Areeb  	Areeb Ullah: You question our loyalty for no reason other than our spiritual beliefs. Will you ever sit down with the diverse peoples who make up Britain and really listen to us?
078-europefearsyriaghostboats	aljazeera	Sun, 04 Jan 2015 07:53:56 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/01/europe-fear-syria-ghost-boats-20151443810338138.html	James Denselow	Europe's fear of Syria's ghost boats	The story of the Ezadeen, the ship set on autopilot and set towards Europe with 450 fleeing Syrian refugees on board, could be a turning point in the European response to the crisis in Syria. With a conflict that has killed some 200,000 people burning brightly on its doorstep Europe's prime focus to date has been on ensuring that it stays away from the flames. The emergence of "ghost ships", the latest gruesome tactic to come out of a conflict that has also put the "barrel bomb" into the popular lexicon, may force a much needed revaluation on the strategy of Europe's response.  &#10;&#10;The discovery of the Ezadeen is simply the latest in an increasing number of horror stories emerging from the Mediterranean Sea. The boat, aptly a former livestock carrier, was found in rough seas some 40 nautical miles off the Italian coast - the second vessel in four days to be found sailing abandoned by its crew.  &#10;&#10;The ghost ships represent both a new tactic - using large cargo ships to move people in winter across longer crossing - and a new trend - that of the refugees coming from Syria. Last year some 230,000 people arrived illegally across the Mediterranean into the EU with Italy receiving the lion’s share of 160,000 whilst 3,500 people died trying to make the crossing. The UNHCR explained that in 2014 for the first time, people mainly from Syria "have become a major component in this tragic flow, accounting for almost 50 per cent of the total".  &#10;&#10;The policy of the EU has largely been one of "Fortress Europe" characterised by the reduction of humanitarian support to sea born refugees and tighter border fences to the east. Whilst Syria's neighbours have accepted the lion's share of the over 3 million Syrian refugees Europe's record remains dismal with a recent summit agreeing on only 33,000 more asylum cases.  &#10;&#10;EU policy is as adrift as many of the refugees who struggle to survive in the Med. The sudden up tick in refugees attempting to travel from Syria and the high risk ghost ships that are used should prompt a review of both the national polices of EU member states and the supra-national EU policy at large. The conflict in Syria is getting worse with 5,000 Syrians fleeing every day (over three a minute) and 2015 could see the number of refugees top 4 million.  &#10;&#10;Europe needs to adopt a more strategic and moral policy towards the Syrian refugee crisis rather than the current position whose failure is measured in the increasing numbers of lives lost to the Mediterranean.  &#10;&#10;It is far easier to attract the attention of policy makers with a counter- terrorism argument than a humanitarian one. The fact is that the smugglers who are purchasing ships for between $100,000 - $150,000 and then filling them up with hundreds of desperate refugees paying $6,000 per person for passage are making serious illicit money.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;Criminal gangs in North Africa and the Middle East that experts warn are "making millions" should be a red flag considering the current conflict with trans-national criminals such as ISIL. Resources should be put into a joined up policing effort that addresses the space that these increasingly wealthy smugglers are able to operate in.  &#10;&#10;The Syrians taking this journey are risking it all on what the UNHCR are calling the "most lethal route in the world". One refugee on board the Ezadeen put it succinctly when he told Italian Coast Guards that "we are alone and we have no one to help us". We must better understand that a conflict that has seen over 12,000 children killed - 3,500 last year alone - is going to force people to desperate ends to find hope of a better tomorrow.  &#10;&#10;Europe must look seriously into accepting larger asylum quotas and focus on giving the most vulnerable a legitimate means of getting to their shores. Meanwhile if the conditions for the vast majority of those refugees in the neighbouring countries deteriorate then again it shouldn't be a surprise to see refugees risk their lives to travel elsewhere. The fact that the World Food Programme had to briefly cut food rations to Syrian refugees due to lack of funding in December is a scandal that shouldn't be allowed to happen again.  &#10;&#10;Finally of course we should never lose sight of the bigger picture. The refugees, whether sheltering from winter in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon or enduring the waves of the Mediterranean, are all symptoms of a conflict whose end appears nowhere in sight. A new year gives Europe a chance to involve itself a new on addressing that most difficult of challenges.  	2015 will be a crucial year in determining Europe's humanitarian response to&#10;the continued chaos in Syria.&#10;&#10;
079-expertblackstrustpolicemoretha	foxnews	2014-12-19T19:08:47Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/12/19/expert-blacks-trust-police-more-than-whites-do/	John Lott	Expert: Blacks trust police more than whites do	  &#10;&#10;Do blacks trust police more than whites do? Given the anger over events in Ferguson and New York City, the very question seems absurd. But it is not. Behind the polls and demonstrations, there is evidence that blacks trust police at least as much as whites do.  &#10;&#10;The poll results are hardly surprising. A new Gallup poll confirms blacks place less confidence in police and the criminal justice system. Using survey data from 2006 through 2014, Gallup found:  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;*31 percentage points more blacks than whites believe black males are more likely to go to prison than white males primarily because of discrimination (50 percent versus 19 percent).  &#10;&#10;*7 percentage points more blacks believe the honesty and ethics of police are low/very low (17 percent versus 10 percent).  &#10;&#10;Similarly, a 2013 Pew Research Centersurvey reveals that 70 percent of blacks believed police treated whites better than blacks. By contrast, only 37 percent of whites agreed.  &#10;&#10;But what people say and what they do are often different. And there are both victims and criminals in black communities.  &#10;&#10;Victims may trust the police for the same reasons that criminals dislike them. Blacks are not a monolithic group: blacks who who have been through the criminal justice system as criminals could answer these questions quite differently than those who have relied on police as victims.  &#10;&#10;The polls don’t distinguish between these two groups. As Charles Barkley recently said: “[Police] are the only thing in the ghetto between this place being the wild, wild west.”  &#10;&#10;Most violent crime victims don’t report crimes to police. For example, only about half of rapes are reported to police. That has a lot to do with how victims believe they will be treated by the police. In the case of rape, victims who think that the police are unsympathetic to rape victims or are unlikely to solve the cases are even less likely to report rapes.  &#10;&#10;If black victims really believe police are racist, why would they report the crime to the police? Blacks victims don’t want other blacks locked up simply due to their race; they want the criminals who actually committed the crime punished.  &#10;&#10;Of course people are more likely to report crimes to police if they believe the police will solve them. Why waste time filling out forms and being interviewed if the crime isn’t going to be solved? If blacks think police are incompetent or dishonest or just don’t care, again there is little reason to turn to the police for help.  &#10;&#10;Yet, blacks don’t shy away from reporting crimes to the police. Data compiled by the Bureau of Justice Statisticsfrom 2008 to 2012 shows that blacks are actually more likely than whites to report violent crimes to the police — 9 percentage points more likely than whites (54 percent to 45 percent).  &#10;&#10;Blacks consistently report violent crimes at a higher rate than whites do. That applies to all income groups as well as for victims living in urban and suburban areas.  &#10;&#10;This higher rate of reporting is true in areas where blacks face higher violent crime rates than whites and also when the reverse is true.  &#10;&#10;The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that whites who are below 200 percent of the poverty level face a higher violent crime rate than blacks with the same income, yet blacks still report those crimes at a higher rate. For incomes above 200 percent of poverty, blacks are more frequent victims of violent crime, but again they are still more likely to report them.  &#10;&#10;On average, blacks are victims of violent crime at much higher rates than whites, but the gap isn’t as large as many people think. Typically, crime rate comparisons are in terms of the FBI crime data — data relying on the number of crimes reported to police. But, as we have just noted, that is misleading, because blacks report violent crimes at higher rates. While the FBI crime numbers show blacks to have a 40 percent higher violent crime rate, the actual difference is about 30 percent.  &#10;&#10;When it comes to crime, the demonstrations and pundits don’t reflect how most blacks feel most of the time. There appears to be a silent majority of blacks who trust the police. Many blacks may get angry about particular cases in the news, but when they have to turn to someone for help, they turn to the police. Blacks apparently trust the police to do their job more frequently than whites do.  &#10;&#10;John R. Lott, Jr. is a columnist for FoxNews.com.

080-fantasyaniranuspartnership	aljazeera	Tue, 06 Jan 2015 10:06:13 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/01/fantasy-an-iran-us-partnership-2015149129238121.html	Seyed Mohammad Marandi	The fantasy of an Iran-US partnership	When US Vice-President Joe Biden told an American university audience in October that Turkey, the UAE and Saudi Arabia are responsible for arming al- Nusra, ISIL, and other al-Qaeda-rooted extremists in Syria and that there is no "moderate middle" in the country, there was (as most non-Americans expected) little coverage of this stunning admission in the US mainstream media.  &#10;&#10;Indeed, what little coverage there was focused on Biden's subsequent apologies to Turkish, Emirati, and Saudi leaders for having made such comments in the first place.  &#10;&#10;Predictably, there was no follow-up reporting in the New York Times reminding Americans that the US is itself complicit in funding and arming extremists in Syria.  &#10;&#10;In early 2013, the newspaper reported what many in the region already knew; that since the beginning of 2012, the CIA had been deeply involved in procuring weapons for anti-Assad forces, airlifting arms to Jordanian and Turkish airports, and "vetting" rebel commanders - all to help US allies "support the lethal side of the civil war". Other reports pointed out that these shipments were actually paid for by US allies, at the bidding of the Obama administration.  &#10;&#10;But, after the Biden revelation, the so-called "newspaper of record" made no reference to how the US, in violation of international law, helped to facilitate the Syrian civil war - and, in the process, to enable the rise of ISIL.  &#10;&#10;Western-backed extremism is neither a new nor regionally-bound concept. Whether it is the "Contra" rebels in Nicaragua or al-Qaeda-like groups in Afghanistan, the objective has always been to achieve strategic objectives through the infliction of mass suffering - for, in the "free and civilised world" of the US and its allies, the utopian end too often justifies the Mephistophelean means.  &#10;&#10;More recently, an important footnote to the Libyan civil war was the involvement of Abdul Hakim Belhaj, previously the leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group as well as an al-Qaeda member.  &#10;&#10;He was one of many Libyan militants influenced by a takfiri (apostate) ideology; the groups with which he was affiliated were designated as terrorist organisations by the US State Department.  &#10;&#10;Nevertheless, he, along with other like-minded militants, became central components in the efforts of western and Arab-backed anti-Gaddafi forces to capture Tripoli, the Libyan capital.  &#10;&#10;Western willingness to cooperate with al-Qaeda (or "former" al-Qaeda) militants in Libya was a major turning point. Even the subsequent death of the US ambassador to Libya did not change US policy in this regard. Belhaj became the representative of Libya's interim president after Gaddafi's overthrow (before the complete ruin of the country).  &#10;&#10;More importantly, the willingness of the US and European and "Middle Eastern" allies to embrace al-Qaeda-like militants took US and western foreign policy in the region back to what it had been before the September 11, 2001 attacks - a policy of cooperation with violent extremists to undermine regional actors the West considers problematic.  &#10;&#10;Monster they created  &#10;&#10;This policy quickly expanded from Libya to Syria and the repercussions are being felt today in countries like Pakistan, Nigeria, Australia, and China.  &#10;&#10;After Gaddafi's overthrow, Turkey - a NATO member - allegedly helped Belhaj to meet with leaders of the so-called "Free Syrian Army" in Istanbul and along the Syrian-Turkish border. In the meetings the former al-Qaeda leader discussed supporting the FSA with money, weapons, and fighters, at a time when the CIA was a major conduit for the transfer of weapons from Libya to Syria.  &#10;&#10;While Belhaj was just one of many al-Qaeda affiliates involved in violent anti-government campaigns in both Libya and Syria, his openly acknowledged role underscores how the supposedly "moderate" FSA was, from early on in the Syrian civil war, as Iran repeatedly warned, deeply associated with and infiltrated by extremists.  &#10;&#10;Over time, the problem grew so large with ISIL's rise that it became impossible to hide the monster that the US and its allies had created. And so, Washington launched yet another chapter in its never-ending post-9/11 "war on terror".  &#10;&#10;Notwithstanding Washington's professed determination to degrade and, ultimately, to destroy ISIL, Iran remains profoundly skeptical of US intentions.  &#10;&#10;Even after dramatic gains by ISIL in Iraq and the formation of a US-led coalition of the guilty to fight it, this coalition has, on average, carried out just nine airstrikes per day in both Iraq and Syria.  &#10;&#10;In comparison, western reports indicate that, in the same period, the Syrian air force alone has at times carried out up to 200 strikes in 36 hours. Even as these largely inconsequential US-led airstrikes are carried out in Iraq and Syria, some regional players continue to provide extensive logistical support to ISIL; along Syria's borders with Jordan and the Israeli regime, the Nusra Front continues to collaborate with other extremist militias backed by foreign (including western) powers.  &#10;&#10;In light of these realities, Iranians - who have been indispensable in preventing the fall of Damascus, Baghdad, Aleppo, and Erbil - simply do not buy the argument that a repentant US is now waging a real war against ISIL, the Nusra Front, and other extremist organisations in Iraq and Syria.  &#10;&#10;Rather, Iranians see the evidence as pointing to a complex (yet foolish) policy undertaken by Washington and its allies for the purpose of "containing" the Islamic Republic.  &#10;&#10;What, then, would be the justification - under such circumstances and as Iranian allies are successfully pushing back extremists in Iraq and Syria - for the Islamic Republic to cooperate with the US in Iraq?  &#10;&#10;No matter how much some may try to tempt it, Iran will not play Faust to America's Mephistopheles.  	Iran remains profoundly skeptical of US intentions and professed determination&#10;to degrade and destroy ISIL.&#10;&#10;
081-fatjokechrischristiefunny	guardian	2015-01-06T12:15:00Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/06/fat-joke-chris-christie-funny	Marianne Kirby	Do you really think your fat joke about Chris Christie is funny?	New Jersey governor Chris Christie’s weight – and whether it will impact any run for higher office – is once again the subject of discussion. (It comes up every year or so, and this year it’s bound to come up every month or so.) On Sunday, Christie drew some people’s ire by sitting with (ok, and hugging) the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, the team of which he is a fan. It doesn’t actually seem to matter what Christie does, though: the kneejerk reaction to a hefty politician is always, inevitably, to insult his body, and now Christie’s brother is even reacting to that reaction on Facebook.  &#10;&#10;There’s a lot that I hate about the way that people – including folks who label themselves progressive and liberal – take Christie’s body to task like it’s public property. I hate that it almost obligates me to defend Chris Christie, since he’s a right-wing Republican and I am most definitely not. But body autonomy is not simply for those with whom we find ourselves in political agreement: As uncomfortable as it makes me to support Christie at all, he’s got just as much of a right to exist free from fat-shaming as any other human being. (Even if he is a Cowboys fan.)  &#10;&#10;Fat people are described as gross and disgusting often enough that some of us loathe our own bodies to the point of self-injury. People think we’re stupid and weak (or we’d just lose weight, right?) before they even talk to us. Fatness is classified as a disease in the United States. For his part, Christie, with his long history of being fat in the public eye, turned to a weight-loss surgery called lap band in his efforts to lose weight. In that last linked article, those close to him claimed it would humanize him in the eyes of the public – without recognizing that he is, in fact and in fat, already human.  &#10;&#10;Our humanity hardly seems to matter to people going for the easy fat jokes.  &#10;&#10;The truth is that fat people often have a more difficult time finding a good job. (Even, maybe especially, THE job.) You’re less likely to get a promotion when your body doesn’t match the image of a desirable employee. This bias – this discrimination – on the part of employers costs them top talent and actually winds up adding to stereotypes about us. It’s hard for fat people to be perceived as hard workers when no one believes in our work ethic in the first place.  &#10;&#10;But that’s hardly the worst of the stereotypes: a couple of years ago, during a televised “debate” about fatness and fat acceptance with anti-obesity spokesperson MeMe Roth and model Crystal Renn, Roth finally gave in and called me stupid – using a single study that proclaim that fat people just have smaller brains and are therefore less intelligent. I laughed: it was a desperate attempt at an insult more than it was scientific discussion, but it was also honest – because it’s definitely not the first time I’ve run across that conviction.  &#10;&#10;Chris Christie, for all of his accomplishments, faces the same sort of discrimination as the fat person passed over for a job because of a hiring manager’s bias – he’s just facing it on a very intense and public level. People look at him and judge his body. They don’t evaluate his intelligence based on his decisions; they just assume he’s stupid because he’s fat. They ignore that it does actually take quite a lot of work to get elected as governor – politics is many things, but it’s never a cake walk, and he’s been involved since 1977. And America has had fat presidents before – not many of them, but some rather notable ones, including Teddy Roosevelt.  &#10;&#10;Chris Christie is – and this is another uncomfortable thing for someone with my own fairly radical political views to say – a complicated and intelligent politician. His actions are often well-considered (even when I screamingly disagree with them, which happens a lot) and even sometimes moderate, at least in the sense that he occasionally works across party lines ... and certainly across state lines when it comes to the NFL.  &#10;&#10;But the fat jokes keep on coming:  &#10;&#10;How bout hittin the gym??... Christie won't back down, may watch Cowboys in Green Bay via @POLITICO for iOS http://t.co/Vn6SS5J4EB  &#10;&#10;US News & World Report’s David Catanese even said that his brother’s defense makes Christie looks bad because … he countered “’crazy, pathetic posts’ with one of his own”. Apparently it’s more presidential when you take the abuse about your body without anyone saying anything.  &#10;&#10;And the fat jokes keep obscuring the actual conversation that needs to happen about Christie’s political views, even as he remains cagey about running for the Republican nomination in 2016. And if you’re one of the people who’d rather insult his weight than talk about his politics, I have to ask: who is the less intelligent person, really? I don’t think it’s the fat guy.

082-feaststephenmiddleeastpersecut	foxnews	2014-12-26T12:00:47Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/12/26/feast-stephen-middle-east-persecuted-christians-need-our-help/	Ralph Peters	The feast of Stephen: Middle East's persecuted Christians need our help	  &#10;&#10;On the day after Christmas, I wish those I meet a “Good St. Stephen’s Day.” Personal quirk? Surely. But it’s also been my small homage to my faith’s first martyr. And this year his all-but-forgotten feast day has a special relevance.  &#10;&#10;To most of us, the “Feast of Stephen” is just an obscure reference in the carol “Good King Wenceslas.” For others, St. Stephen’s a cryptic name in an early Grateful Dead song. But Stephen was the first example, after Christ, of a believer so firm in his faith that he preferred death to betraying his beliefs. At a time when the disciples and apostles clung to the shadows, fearing persecution, Stephen went boldly to his death by stoning.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Now stoning’s back, along with martyrdom, but we look away. We refuse to see martyrs among the Middle East’s Christians. Politically correct toward Islam, while scoffing at Christianity and Judaism, we’ve abandoned the concept of martyrdom to our enemies, to devils in human form who, far from being martyrs, are murderers drenched in the blood of countless innocents. Infernal organizations, such as the Islamic State, Al Qaeda, the Taliban and others, don’t produce “martyrs.” They create them.  &#10;&#10;Herod was mild in comparison.  &#10;&#10;We have watched in near-silence as Christians and other minorities have been evicted from ancient homes and exterminated in a Biblical landscape. As churches shot flames heavenward, we explained away our enemies’ fanaticism and even blamed ourselves for his atrocities. As two millennia of Christian culture in the Middle East suffered the greatest catastrophe in the faith’s entire history, we invented legal rights for blood-soaked barbarians.  &#10;&#10;If recent reports from Iraq prove true—that four Christian boys were beheaded for refusing to convert—we are again in an age of martyred saints. When “the Sea of Faith was once, too, at the full,” Christian Churches, east and west, would have sought the canonization of such believers. But today displays of Christian devotion are mocked as blithely as Christ with his crown of thorns.  &#10;&#10;Our entertainers laud their own “courage” for mocking Christians and Jews, but dare not make one joke about Islam. Our leaders care not a jot for the fate of the Christian civilization of the east—which dominated the faith’s first thousand years. We refuse even to name the enemy honestly.  &#10;&#10;The term “Holocaust” has been abused by those slovenly in language and in spirit, but we are, indeed, witnessing a Christian Holocaust. And it is nearing completion.  &#10;&#10;“Never again” is humanity’s emptiest promise.  &#10;&#10;As a Western Christian, I honor St. Stephen on the day after our Christmas. Eastern-rite churches hold his feast on December 27th. But soon there will be no conflicts on the calendar—the Middle-Eastern churches will be gone.  &#10;&#10;As fearful Peter denied Christ, we have abandoned his churches.  &#10;&#10;So, on this Feast of Stephen, spare a thought not only for the leftovers in the fridge, but for the driven, kidnapped, enslaved, raped, tortured and murdered Christians our sloth and scorn have left to a hell on earth.  &#10;&#10;We are the greedy innkeepers of Bethlehem, and we are the gawking crowds at the Crucifixion.  	On this Feast of Stephen, spare a thought not only for the leftovers in the&#10;fridge, but for the driven, kidnapped, enslaved, raped, tortured and murdered&#10;Christians our sloth and scorn have left to a hell on earth.&#10;&#10;

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio is left, and Charles Ramsey, Philadelphia police commissioner, is center. (AP Photo)  &#10;&#10;As a response to the police shooting of Michael Brown, President Obama proposes $263 million for police training and body cameras. But more police training wouldn’t have prevented the Brown shooting and the president’s proposal plays into the hands of those who blame the police.  &#10;&#10;President Obama has continually undermined police departments around the country, and his demand for more training fits that pattern. In 2009, he jumped to the conclusion that Cambridge, Massachusetts police “acted stupidly” when they arrested Henry Gates. He personalized the Trayvon Martin investigation in a way that to many implied the murder was radically motivated. And yet again last week, he emphasized that the anger to the verdict was “an understandable reaction” and blacks’ distrust of police is “rooted in realities.”  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Nevertheless, whatever Obama implies, there was absolutely no evidence Officer Darren Wilson was motivated by race and he did exactly what he should have done. Brown’s robbery of the convenience store, his decision to reach into the police car and punch Wilson while trying to take his gun, and finally Brown’s decision to charge Wilson was what caused the teen’s death.  &#10;&#10;Under Missouri law, people can defend themselves with deadly force if they have a “reasonable belief” they need to use it to protect themselves against serious injury or death. Wilson claimed: “I felt that another of those punches in my face could knock me out or worse … I’ve already taken two to the face and I didn’t think I would, the third one could be fatal if he hit me right.” When Brown later charged Wilson, despite repeated warnings to stop, Wilson worried that he no choice but to shoot Brown.  &#10;&#10;But we don’t have to take Wilson’s word for what happened. The forensic evidence is overwhelmingly consistent with his story. There is no doubt that Brown reached in Wilson’s car and hit him. Brown’s DNA was found on Wilson’s gun. Despite strong social pressure, three black witnesses confirmed Wilson’s testimony.  &#10;&#10;Police officers in America have a more dangerous job than many people realize and they behave remarkably well under these circumstances.  &#10;&#10;In 2013, the assault rate for the general public in the United States was 229 per 100,000 people. But the rate police were assaulted that year was 9,300 per 100,000 officers – a rate 41 times higher. The only reason that police don’t die at as high of a rate as people in other professions is because of their training and the fact that they are armed.  &#10;&#10;Would you consider it “dangerous” to live in Detroit? After all, it has by far the highest assault rate in the country, at 1,257 per 100,000 people. But police are still 7.4 times more likely to be assaulted (=9,300/1,257).  &#10;&#10;Aggravated assaults don’t necessarily involve injuries, just the attempt to cause serious bodily injury, but police are injured at a very high rate – 2,700 per 100,000 police officer. That is still much higher than the total assault data for civilians.  &#10;&#10;This data also suggests that police are not actively looking for excuses to fire their weapons. The number of justifiable killings by police equals less than one percent of the assaults on police. Thus even when assaulted, police rarely resort to killing their attackers.  &#10;&#10;As Ferguson is showing us, physical risks aren’t the only risks that police face. On Saturday Officer Darren Wilson resigned from the Ferguson police department, fearing that protestors would use his continued presence to justify rioting. He is going to have a hard time getting a job, and he didn’t get any severance pay. Who will hire him now? Surely no other police department will hire him. And, any company that would hire Wilson would fear the same protests.  &#10;&#10;With Wilson facing civil suits and Attorney General Eric Holder’s federal investigation still ongoing, the pressures on Officer Wilson are not likely to fade away anytime soon.  &#10;&#10;It’s safe to say that other police officers will be carefully watching what happens to Wilson.  &#10;&#10;Yes, racism is despicable. And there have been abuses by police in the past. But 2014 isn’t 1960. Police have a difficult and dangerous job, and President Obama could help to calm things down if he and his administration weren’t so quick to assume that police officers are the only ones at fault.  &#10;&#10;John R.

An African-American business owner, surveying the destruction of his store, plaintively asked, “How am I going to feed my kids?”  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;I have an answer and it is one that should be applied to anyone convicted of riotous behavior, destruction of property and looting. It’s called restitution.  &#10;&#10;Restitution is an Old Testament concept instituted to remind people that when one harms another person, or steals or destroys property, someone else suffers and deserves reimbursement. It says the state is less a debtor than the victim of a crime. Restitution can also instill true moral guilt in a person, which can lead to genuine repentance and a decision by the perpetrator to make different choices leading to a better life.  &#10;&#10;As the authorities in Ferguson examine videos that show the faces of many of the rioters and looters, charges will undoubtedly be filed. If convicted, the perpetrators should be forced to pay for the damage they caused.  &#10;&#10;If they have jobs, their paychecks should be garnished. If they are on welfare, those checks should be forwarded to the businesses they destroyed.  &#10;&#10;If they receive food-purchasing assistance, that assistance should be withdrawn. This should be the practice going forward. Those who destroy their communities will be required to pay back those harmed by their hooliganism and forfeit any government benefits they receive. This might require legislation, but politicians should have the public’s support.  &#10;&#10;A close relative of restitution is shaming. The convicted should be brought before those harmed by their behavior and publicly shamed.  &#10;&#10;No one seems to be ashamed of anything nowadays, but shaming might help prevent future violence. Rioters and looters who are black could be shamed by law-abiding African-Americans.  &#10;&#10;They can be asked, “Is this why Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. marched and went to prison? Is this why he paid the ultimate price? Would he and other civil rights leaders dating back to Frederick Douglass be proud of your behavior today? Don’t you owe them something better than this?”  &#10;&#10;Perhaps if people realize that their destructive behavior will cost them something, they think might twice about harming others and robbing them of a living.  &#10;&#10;People from around the country are reportedly donating money to help those whose businesses were destroyed. That again demonstrates the generosity of Americans of all races and backgrounds.  &#10;&#10;While donations will help, along with insurance, if it covers damage caused by violent protesters, the lawbreakers should still be required to take responsibility for their actions. In addition to whatever legal penalties might result, restitution and shaming should be part of the punishment.  &#10;&#10;We’ve gotten away from personal responsibility and accountability, preferring instead to cast lawbreakers as “victims,” when the true victims are often ignored. Too often many blame others for their circumstances.  &#10;&#10;Too often many feel entitled to what others have achieved through hard work and dedication.  &#10;&#10;Too often too many feel justified in taking and destroying the property of others instead of working and building for themselves.  &#10;&#10;If they don’t feel ashamed, they should.  	Restitution is an Old Testament concept instituted to remind people that when&#10;one harms another person, or steals or destroys property, someone else suffers&#10;and deserves reimbursement.&#10;&#10;
085-fiftyshadesofironingsheddingin	guardian	2015-01-06T19:30:12Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/06/fifty-shades-of-ironing-shedding-inhibitions	Catherine Shoard	Coming soon: Fifty Shades of Ironing	As anyone who has been in a card shop lately will know, Valentine’s Day is almost upon us. Like the petals of the mutabilis rose, still blooming in this global warming winter, the envelopes have turned from Christmas crimson to infatuated fuchsia. The plush reindeer have been stabled in the stock room, replaced by shelves of bears, declarations of love stitched to their torsos in the colour of blood. An Italian importer has started supplying to UK pubs a range of heart-shaped ravioli stuffed with cheese, tomato and basil, which can be reheated from frozen and cost £30 per 3kg pack.  &#10;&#10;And if you thought Valentine’s Day couldn’t get more romantic, here comes Fifty Shades of Grey, the movie version of EL James’s sex slave saga, released just in time on Friday the 13th. Will it score or will it flop? The auguries are good: Fifty Shades is the bestselling book in Britain since records began; and more than 100m copies have been flogged worldwide. The trailer for the film was the most-watched on YouTube last year, beating even Star Wars.  &#10;&#10;Yet until recently I was sceptical. After all, books and trailers can be consumed with relative privacy. To see a movie legally you must leave your house, queue up, ask someone for a ticket and then sit down in the company of others. And unlike, say, Basic Instinct and 9 1/2 weeks, Fifty Shades is not couples-friendly softcore, but specifically aimed at one gender. Even the most tolerant boyfriend would balk. Will women go solo? With girlfriends? Might it be another Mamma Mia! – still the highest grossing musical movie ever – with vast parties of galpals going again and again? Surely not.  &#10;&#10;But the journey to work over the past few days has made me realise what an outmoded prude I am. It is no longer considered inappropriate for people – women, anyway – to openly consume porn in public. I had ascribed Fifty Shades’s popularity to the rise of the e-reader, with its brown paper wrapping of propriety. But many commuters have their nose in the book itself, bondage cover on proud display, enjoying erotica in what might seem to be strikingly unsexy surroundings.  &#10;&#10;Perhaps this isn’t about porn. Maybe it’s just a general slippage in inhibition. People seem happy enough to eat their breakfast and apply mascara with a stranger’s thighs a couple of inches from their face; to treat the whole bus to their intimate phone calls. Perhaps it’s not arrogance, but practicality: no one has enough time or space anymore. What you used to do in the bathroom or bedroom you now do on the commute.  &#10;&#10;I need to make it work for me. Porn and sandwiches will take some getting used to, but I often struggle to get all my ironing done at home – and frequently travel on trains equipped with plugs and what I suspect are heat-resistant tables … though in its way that could be a world of pain too.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;Last week my backlog of creased clothes was so enormous I went to the sales to buy new ones. The crowds were a doddle compared with the bleak epiphany of the changing room mirror. A diet is clearly essential. Likewise a wholescale rethink of hair and even face, plus radical fitness regime, implemented ASAP. At the moment I favour the Serena Williams method: with defeat looming in a match on Tuesday, she ordered a coffee mid-game and went on to thrash her opponent. No vitamin bars. No isotonic drinks. No complex stretches. Just coffee. I can do that.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;Perhaps it’s just the clothes that got small – endless frocks ruined by the wrong wash option. Lucky, then, that this week electronics giant LG unveiled a swanky machine which runs two cycles simultaneously: hot cottons up top, cooler smalls below. “Today’s busy families consider laundry to be less like a chore and more like a chess match,” explained LG’s David VanderWaal. The statement is at once baffling and patronising; exactly what you’d expect from a firm that programmes its TVs to tell their owners “Life’s Good” each time they turn them on. I still can’t get used to this – it always provokes a little stab of despair, as if you’re trapped in a future so terrible that even household gadgets have been deputed to encourage you not to top yourself.

(AP Photo/Michael Probst)  &#10;&#10;The European Central Bank has just announced a €60 billion ($69 billion) monthly government bond buying program—Quantitative Easing—but that won’t do much for the moribund continental economy.  &#10;&#10;Central banks can print money to purchase government bonds to push up prices and lower interest rates on those assets and competing debt, such as corporate bonds and bank loans. In the United States, the Federal Reserve also bought billions in federally-sponsored mortgage-backed securities, such as those issued by Fannie Mae.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;The aim is to encourage more borrowing by businesses and homebuyers—stimulus spending financed by running the printing press.  &#10;&#10;The Fed enjoyed some success boosting U.S. growth, but here are five reasons why QE won’t work for the ECB.  &#10;&#10;1\. Eurozone Is Not a Country. The European Union does not have a large budget and issues few euro-denominated bonds the ECB could purchase. Instead, the ECB will have to purchase individual country debt—it is as if the Fed had to purchase a basket of bonds issued by California, Iowa and other states.  &#10;&#10;Markets for European bonds—both sovereign and corporate—and bank lending are highly fragmented along country lines. Consequently, it is unlikely that QE will have much effect on banks’ willingness to make new business loans in places buffeted by the financial crisis, like Spain and Greece.  &#10;&#10;2\. EU Has No Fannie Mae. QE seems to work best when central banks inject capital directly into specific markets. The Fed purchased mortgage-backed securities that significantly lowered interest rates on mortgages across America. Housing prices recovered much of the value lost during the financial crisis, and new home construction rebounded.  &#10;&#10;The EU has no analog to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the ECB cannot readily purchase mortgage-backed securities to boost the European housing sector.  &#10;&#10;3\. Fiscal Policy Is Pulling in the Opposite Direction. Europe’s largest economy, Germany, recently accomplished a balanced budget for the first time since 1969, and austerity programs intended to restore solvency have forced massive government spending cuts and tax increases in Spain, Greece and other Mediterranean states.  &#10;&#10;Those spending cuts—though essential to sorely needed structural reforms—will undercut the effects of any increased bank lending ECB bond purchase may induce. With unemployment hovering at about 25 percent in Spain and Greece, and 13 percent in Italy, banks will remain skeptical that lending to expand businesses will do much to create bigger markets for what they sell.  &#10;&#10;4\. QE Does Little to Fix Euro-Imposed Dysfunctions. Although structural reforms could make Greece, Italy and other high unemployment economies more attractive places to build factories and establish businesses in the long run, governments in Athens, Rome and other capitals face voters who need jobs now. And the cost of labor—though perhaps gradually falling—in these countries will remain too high to attract investment for many years.  &#10;&#10;If Mediterranean countries still had their own currencies, those could let their currencies fall in value relative to those of northern European states. That would re-price labor to attract investment and jobs. But the single currency, the euro, deprives them of that lever.  &#10;&#10;5\. Absence of Pan European Institutions. Though the Europeans have a single currency, they lack common education standards and language that gives the United States a more or less single labor market.  &#10;&#10;In the absence of currency devaluation to re-price Mediterranean labor, Greeks, Italians and Spaniards cannot migrate to Germany where unemployment is only 5 percent, with the same ease that Americans have migrated to South Dakota and Texas to participate in the oil boom. In the end, the EU and ECB lacks what the Fed enjoys—the punch of a national government that ran large deficits to augment its efforts to pull the U.S. economy out of recession and national credit, housing and labor markets that made monetary policies—like QE—reasonably effective.

Documented evidence reveals him to be a ruthless tyrant who endlessly abused the most basic of human rights –a man who played a pivotal role in bringing the world to the precipice of nuclear annihilation for 13 harrowing days in October of 1962.  &#10;&#10;Beyond his crimes against humanity and the callous suffering he inflicted on the people of Cuba, he ruined the lives and livelihoods of thousands of Americans. He stole their land, homes, bank accounts, possessions and businesses. He absconded with their property under the guise of “nationalization.” But he is, in truth, a thief.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Will his victims now be fairly compensated or otherwise see the return of their confiscated property in the wake of America’s first steps toward rapprochement with Cuba? The answer is both legal and political. President Obama holds the key. So, don’t get your hopes up.  &#10;&#10;The Theft  &#10;&#10;In the first half of the 20th century, Americans and U.S. businesses dominated Cuba. They accumulated vast holdings of property and operated many of the most lucrative businesses. All of that ended with the Cuban Revolution in 1959. Castro “nationalized” U.S.-owned industries and seized much of the island’s private property from Americans. There was no restitution. One legal scholar called it the largest uncompensated expropriation by a foreign government in history.  &#10;&#10;The U.S. retaliated with an embargo, prohibiting all trade. But the Americans who were expelled from Cuba were left holding titles and deeds to homes and businesses to which they had no access. Their property rights were dissolved, and any legal judgments obtained were unenforceable against an isolated nation that refused to recognize any authority other than its own.  &#10;&#10;Thousands pursued legal recourse and sought reparations under indemnification programs established by Congress. Others filed lawsuits and secured judgments. But Castro didn’t care. He repudiated the legitimacy of the restitution programs, the valuation of losses and the legal authority of the courts. This, even though Cuba admits their renegade nationalization was, and is, compensable.  &#10;&#10;So what, then, does Castro consider fair compensation? Judging from his payouts to other aggrieved nations, it is mere pennies on the dollar.  &#10;&#10;How do you value dirt?  &#10;&#10;In 1961, the U.S. Commerce Department valued American property seized by the Cuban government at roughly $ 1 to 1.8 billion. Nearly 6-thousand claims were legally certified. Other published reports placed the theft as high as $ 9 billion. But the truth is, it’s impossible to know –especially inasmuch as the value of everything plummeted the moment Castro took control of the island.  &#10;&#10;What would the same confiscated properties be worth in today’s dollars? $50 billion? $100 billion? How about nothing at all? Given how the Castro brothers have driven their economy into the ground, making Cuba one of the poorest nations in the world, valuation could be closer to dirt than dollars.  &#10;&#10;Which invites another question: assuming a monetary value could somehow be devised, how would Cuba pay for it? With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Castros lost their financial benefactor. The island is blighted and broke. Even if it offered government bonds as compensation, are they worth the paper upon which they are written? How could they be secured?  &#10;&#10;Reclaim the property?  &#10;&#10;Theoretically, it is possible for the confiscated property to be reclaimed someday by the original owners. But that would require a dramatic Cuban transformation from socialism to democracy where private property ownership is permitted. In a recent speech, Cuban President Raul Castro insisted Cuba would not renounces its core socialist ideals as part of the deal he negotiated with President Obama to renew diplomatic relations.  &#10;&#10;Even if some semblance of democracy were to be restored to Cuba in the distant future, what remains of the stolen property? No one knows how many of the private residences that were seized have been divided or fallen into decay. Some may no longer exist. And what of the current occupants? Would they allow themselves to be kicked out?  &#10;&#10;The same may be true of the many farms, industries and commercial businesses that were confiscated and have been put to other uses in the last 5 decades. Yes, they have development potential in an open, free market society. But, again, the future of Cuba is nebulous. How realistic is the return of these vast holdings under a continuing Castro regime?  &#10;&#10;What Obama should do  &#10;&#10;As a first condition to normalizing relations, President Obama should demand that all American victims of stolen property be compensated equitably. He is already obligated by law to do this under the Helms-Burton Act. But Obama has a propensity to ignore or overrule with impunity those laws he regards as misguided or inconvenient. This is one law he should follow.  &#10;&#10;A second condition should be the establishment of a commission of judges with legally binding authority to render compensation decisions. Several reparation models can be studied and replicated, notably the tribunal that dispensed claims in post-unification Germany.  &#10;&#10;President Obama has the power and leverage to force the Castro regime to capitulate if Cuba wants to end the sanctions and restore economic relations. But so far, he has uttered not a word about a desire to do so.  &#10;&#10;And when it comes to negotiations with adversaries, Obama tends to give away the store.  	The future of Cuba is nebulous. How realistic is the return of these vast&#10;holdings to Americans under a continuing Castro regime?&#10;&#10;
088-foiegrasdeliciouscaliforniaban	guardian	2015-01-09T15:23:12Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/09/foie-gras-delicious-california-ban-lifted	Samantha Gillison	Foie gras is exactly as delicious as you've heard. It should nonetheless be banned	When a US judge struck down California’s 2 1/2 year old foie gras ban on Wednesday, a Napa Valley chef said he’d been “jumping up and down for 90 minutes.” I’ll bet you were, dude. Foie gras hits you in your animal pleasure center with the force of a bullet train and gives you, experientially, a high closer to that of a narcotic than sexual gratification.  &#10;&#10;I was 19 and at le Grand Vefour, the legendary Parisian restaurant, when I first ate foie gras. An unassuming ceramic tub of what looked and smelled a bit like cat food arrived at the table with a glass of Sauternes the color of a hepatitis patient’s urine to wash it down. My first, tentative, nibble of foie gras resists any food critic hyperbole for which I could reach to describe how wonderful it was – and has been every time since.  &#10;&#10;You can’t argue convincingly with the extraordinarily pleasurable experience of eating foie gras. However, you also can’t argue convincingly – although many foodies try – that gavage, the force-feeding process which produces the stuff, isn’t torture or, at at minimum, animal cruelty of a most hideous type.  &#10;&#10;I am an unapologetic omnivore who worships at the altar of good (and “bad”) food – so, hardly an animal rights advocate – and I believe that, for the most part, people have the right to to put what they want in their mouths. But the State of California was correct to ban foie gras, and I sincerely hope Attorney General Kamala Harris fights to get the ban reinstated.  &#10;&#10;Contemplate gavage for a moment: for two or three weeks, migratory birds (ducks, geese) are kept in cages. Three times a day they have steel funnels shoved down their throats; an auger is turned; and they are force fed. The birds’ livers grow enormous – eventually taking up half the space of their lower body. Aquatic birds, like ducks and geese, evolved as creatures who spend most of their time on the water, only occasionally foraging on land. They are social animals who like to hang out in groups, preen and communicate with each other via display and call. Sitting in a cage for a few weeks being force-fed is a horrible fate for any sentient being, but it is particularly nasty for these migratory birds.  &#10;&#10;Some foie gras lovers argue that gavage can be ethical: there are “good” poultry farmers who use flexible plastic tubes instead of steel to force feed birds who get to roam around barns. Anthony Bourdain famously commented that “you see worse [than gavage] in the pay-per-view film on the hotel channel – and that’s people, for God’s sake”. (Presumably he was referring to fellatio). Then there’s the “civilized” cultures argument: the ancient Egyptians, the Greeks, the Romans used gavage to produce foie gras, therefore as a similarly “civilized” culture we should be similarly allowed to force feed birds.  &#10;&#10;Possibly the most specious argument against the California ban came from the plaintiffs’ lawyer, Michael Tenenbaum, who called the ruling “ a victory for freedom.” Tenenbaum wasn’t ad-libbing: many chefs and foodies have held that banning foie gras is the equivalent to “cultural imperialism” and is an abridgment of their basic rights. If Tenenbaum, too, truly believes that, he should be litigating for chefs’ rights to make shark fin soup, fry up songbirds, pour boiling oil into live monkeys’ brains, and in general cook up anything they damn well please.  &#10;&#10;I get nervous when people – even really smart, talented people – use the word “freedom” to mean “I get to do what I want”. In the case of foie gras bans, the argument is that, because this food is so delicious, you get to eat it, cook with it, produce it and make money off it – no matter that it’s produced as the result of an inhumane practice which has been documented by scientists as causing severe, prolonged suffering to animals.  &#10;&#10;The discontent of civilization, as Freud once pointed out, is that we don’t all get to do what we want. The price of getting to live among our fellow humans in a truly civilized society is that we have to repress some of our urges. I love everything about eating foie gras – but I do it rarely, and I look forward to the day when I won’t be able to find it on a menu.  	Samantha Gillison: California was right to ban one of the most amazing things I’ve ever tasted. The cruelty inflicted to obtain it was never worth it
089-forgetthegstonfoodabbottneedst	guardian	2015-01-12T04:35:23Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/12/forget-the-gst-on-food-abbott-needs-to-present-a-new-grand-bargain-to-the-nation	Kristina Keneally	Forget the GST on food. Abbott needs to present a new 'grand bargain' to the nation	The problem with not applying the GST to fresh food is that rich people aren’t paying GST on fresh food. Taxing the purchase of fresh food is estimated to provide an additional $6bn in government revenue each year. For a federal government with a revenue problem, it must be infuriating to forego billions from people who can fairly easily afford to pay.  &#10;&#10;The problem with applying the GST to fresh food is that poor people would be paying GST on fresh food. Households in the lowest 20% of income earners pay almost two and a half times more GST, as a percentage of income, than households in the highest 20%. For a federal government with a now-cemented reputation for unfairness, it would be foolhardy to make life even more expensive for those who can least afford to pay.  &#10;&#10;Sure, the government could provide GST relief through compensation payments to low-income people, but such payments are inefficient at meeting the actual cost of the tax. They also create another ongoing obligation on the public purse.  &#10;&#10;Some people might consider this a political conundrum, but not some of the fearless members of the Abbott government. Senators Ian Macdonald and Dean Smith, MP Dan Tehan, and trade minister Andrew Robb are rushing forth to call for changes to the rate and base of the GST, including applying the tax to fresh food. The father of Australia’s GST, John Howard, has opined in recent years that it was a “pity” Labor did not support the GST on fresh food in 1999.  &#10;&#10;Now others are stepping forward with proposals. Unsurprisingly, business groups want to increase the GST and decrease company tax. The Australia Institute has argued the government could lessen the regressive impact of the GST by expanding the base to include private education and private healthcare – services largely consumed by those on higher incomes - which it estimates would raise an additional $2.3bn a year. It’s an intriguing idea with political appeal, but there are potential budgetary disincentives if the tax pushes people off private services back on to free government services.  &#10;&#10;All this public speculation is leading to the impression that the Abbott government does not have control of the GST agenda. The implications are dreadful for the Coalition. Just ask Campbell Newman and Mike Baird how delighted they are to campaign in a climate of GST hypotheticals.  &#10;&#10;Some conservative commentators have claimed that all the Abbott government needs to do to stem the freefall in the polls is to get its messaging right. Surely in 2015, they say, a better sales pitch – and a fresh-faced young assistant treasurer in Josh Frydenberg – will turn around the public’s opinion of the government and its budget.  &#10;&#10;What these folks misunderstand is that good policy makes good politics and no policy makes terrible politics. Right now, the Abbott government has no overarching policy agenda, no coherent narrative, no holistic approach to the nation’s current budgetary challenges. Rather, it has surprise measures (reintroduction of fuel indexation), broken promises (cuts to the ABC, health, education and the pension), wild new spending commitments (PPL), counter- productive new taxes (GP co-payment), and random thought-bubbles of the kind currently proffered by minister Robb and co.  &#10;&#10;Where to start in solving the problem? First, instead of pushing a lot of random levers in its budget and hoping some of them work, the government needs to put forward a “grand bargain” to the people of Australia: fixing our budget means we need to fix our complicated, inefficient federation. We need to work out who is going to do what to whom, and who is going to pay for it. It also means fixing our tax system, not just tinkering with high-income levies or raising the GST by a couple of per cent.  &#10;&#10;In short, the federation and tax reform white papers should come out as soon as possible. Frankly, these should have come out much, much earlier. What were Coalition members doing as they sat on the Opposition benches waiting to win the “unloseable election”?  &#10;&#10;Secondly, as part of this “grand bargain”, the government needs to get real about ending the age of entitlement. Right now, it is just code for punishing the poor and protecting the rich. The tax system doesn’t just have to be fair; it has to be seen to be fair. Asking the lowest income people to pay GST on fresh food while continuing to give high-income superannuants and investment- property owners massive tax concessions would keep the age of entitlement alive – for those at the top of the income scales.  	The current GST debate shows that the Abbott government has no overarching policy agenda to fix the budget. What was it doing in Opposition?

They have made our lives better	FILE -- Nov. 12, 2014: Lydia Holland replaces the gas nozzle after filling up at a gas station in Sacramento, Calif. (AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli)  &#10;&#10;People argue about whether the “consensus” of scientists is that we face disaster because of global warming. Instead of debating whether man’s greenhouse gasses will raise temperatures, we should argue about how we gauge disasters.  &#10;&#10;If you take most environmentalists and climate scientists at their word, the Earth heated up about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit over the past century, not much more than it heated up the century before that. Warming may increase, but no one can be certain of that.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Let’s agree for the sake of argument that this recent warming was partly caused by humanity. Let’s also agree that there are some negative effects, including more frequent coastal flooding or longer droughts.  &#10;&#10;If we agree that those are costs, shouldn’t we also look at the benefits? Much of modern civilization owes its existence to our use of the fossil fuels that produce the greenhouse gasses.  &#10;&#10;I don’t see that civilization as misfortune. I wish climate alarmists would weigh its accomplishments against the relatively small downsides of climate change. One of industry’s biggest accomplishments is creating a world where far fewer of us are likely to die because of weather.  &#10;&#10;Alex Epstein’s book “The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels” documents the rapidly shrinking number of human beings killed by storms, floods and other climate events thanks largely to ever-growing industry, fueled mainly by oil, natural gas and coal.  &#10;&#10;On "Stossel" my Fox Business Network TV show this week, he argues that if we compare conditions a century ago to conditions last year, we shouldn’t obsess about how much carbon dioxide is in the air -- or whether Earth is warming -- we should look at how much safer life became.  &#10;&#10;In 2013, “Climate-related deaths were at a record low -- in supposedly the worst climate in history -- under 30,000,” says Epstein. In 1931, bad weather killed 3 million people.  &#10;&#10;You can argue that we get some things wrong as a civilization, but thanks to our use of fossil fuels, we get something very right.  &#10;&#10;Epstein points out that humanity owes its current ability to survive harsh winters, arid deserts and other naturally -dangerous environments to the same fuels that activists now condemn: “We have the luxury of being able to absorb a certain amount of climate-related damage so we can live in all of these cool places.”  &#10;&#10;His argument is unusual because environmentalists spread the idea that, without human interference, the planet is perfect.  &#10;&#10;But by what standard?  &#10;&#10;“If you went to someone 300 years ago and asked them, do you have a perfect climate?” they would think you were crazy, says Epstein. “They were terrified of climate, because climate doesn’t give you the resources that you need. It doesn’t give you water when you need it. It doesn’t give you the temperature when you need it.”  &#10;&#10;It was once common to say that humans change their environment. That shouldn’t offend people today, says Epstein. We should be thrilled that humans “create technology to master climate. ... That’s why so few people today die from climate.”  &#10;&#10;Epstein correctly says that instead of talking about “climate change” -- of which there will always be some, with or without human influence -- we should focus on “climate catastrophe,” weather that actually kills people. Those catastrophes, measured in lost lives, are getting rarer.  &#10;&#10;Most of the changes humans make to our environment are desirable changes that help us live longer and more comfortably. “The dogma that man is ruining the planet rather than improving it is a religion, a source of prestige and a career for too many people.”  &#10;&#10;If we regard nature as pristine and think it must never be altered, we will have big problems. We will die young and lead miserable, difficult lives.  &#10;&#10;I think of industry as something that is mostly very good for us, with a few minor side effects that aren’t. Fossil fuels are a little like antibiotics, says Epstein. It’s good to draw attention to minor side effects, but it would be crazy to abandon all treatment because of them.  &#10;&#10;Fossil fuels are no catastrophe. They contribute to health and a better life.  &#10;&#10;John Stossel is the host of "Stossel" (Thursdays at 9 PM/ET), a weekly program highlighting current consumer issues with a libertarian viewpoint.

Although the federal government distributes about $170bn a year in financial aid to many types of students attending many types of schools, many low-income families still have to pay too much. Low-income families often end up paying about 40% of their family income for a member to attend community college – and, for four-year colleges, the bill can add up to a whopping 59% of a family’s earnings. Even middle-class families may be asked to spend or borrow a quarter of their annual income to finance one child’s attendance at a public university, while the costs of a private one are yet higher.  &#10;&#10;As a result, many families of modest means are unable to afford college. Students from middle- and low-income families have also become more likely to drop out from public colleges and universities, leaving with debts they can’t afford to pay back rather than degrees. But these are more than just personal tragedies: they represent a significant loss to America’s economy and competitiveness for decades to come.  &#10;&#10;On Friday, President Obama offered a simple, universal solution: free tuition for two years at community colleges for students who maintain a 2.5 grade point average, attend at least half-time and make steady progress towards completing their program. The federal government would cover three-quarters of the average cost of community college, and participating states would be expected to pick up the rest.  &#10;&#10;The last time a president did something this bold on higher education was the original Higher Education Act of 1965. Then, President Lyndon Johnson had a huge Democratic majority in Congress to support his proposal. President Obama, on the other hand, faces a tougher road in a government run by Republicans who are reluctant to support spending more money to help poor and middle class people – yet they should forego partisanship and take this legislation seriously.  &#10;&#10;Instead of being available only to the poorest students (like Pell grants) free community college tuition would be available for all. The most powerful and enduring American social policies – Social Security, infrastructure investments like the highway system and indeed public education itself – have always benefitted everyone. As it stands now, America’s outdated student aid policies simply aren’t fulfilling their mission and are instead actively failing to make college affordable for all students.  &#10;&#10;And, unlike many other proposals to fix the twin problems of college affordability and student debt focused on four-year programs, free community college has the potential to meet the immediate needs of employers, who often say that they cannot find potential candidates with needed skills. Community college programs in fields like nursing, technology and even management are designed to give students the skills that employers need more quickly than the average bachelor’s degree program.  &#10;&#10;Obama’s plan is far from perfect. It is not a catch-all solution, and other major problems in American higher education still need to be addressed – including for-profit colleges that consume vast amounts of federal aid dollars but often leave students with little more than terrible debt burdens. The costs of private and public four-year institutions should not be ignored, so that the number of bachelor degree graduates will again rise. And the President’s proposal only gives students a discount on tuition, which is just one part (albeit a major one) of the cost of going to school.  &#10;&#10;Yet there is no question that Congress should, if anything, seek to outdo Obama with an even more ambitious proposal, rather than negotiate to reduce his package. They should not let this proposal die upon arrival. Families can’t afford to wait through more years of inaction.  &#10;&#10;[Editor’s note: The author advised the White House on this effort, but was not compensated for her work.]  	Sara Goldrick-Rab: Rising tuition and student loan debts mean that more students are dropping out of or never go to university. Obama’s plan is a big part of the solution
092-freedomoffencecharliehebdois	aljazeera	Thu, 15 Jan 2015 01:07:51 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/01/freedom-offence-charlie-hebdo-is-20151148547873899.html	Hatem Bazian	The freedom to take offence	In the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo murders, Ahmed Merabet's brother Malek correctly declared: "My brother was Muslim and he was killed by two terrorists, by two false Muslims … Islam is a religion of peace and love. As far as my brother's death is concerned it was a waste. He was very proud of the name Ahmed Merabet, proud to represent the police and of defending the values of the republic - liberty, equality, fraternity."  &#10;&#10;As the new edition of Charlie Hebdo hits the stands with another cartoon cover depicting a weeping Prophet Muhammad under the heading "All is forgiven", a critical question must be asked. Whom are we poking fun at? The terrorists or Muslims in general?  &#10;&#10;How can we use the prophet as the signpost to make fun of the terrorists while Lassana Bathily, a young Muslim immigrant from Mali, saved a whole group in the kosher supermarket and provided police with the key to ending the hostage crisis at the store. Could it be that his inspiration and values are informed by the example of the prophet; did we ask how he feels about the new cartoon and do we care to listen to the answer?  &#10;&#10;Who is being forgiven - the prophet, the terrorists or Muslims who believe in Islam and rightly hold the prophet in high esteem? By framing the response with the prophet cartoon, Charlie Hebdo is echoing CEO Rupert Murdoch's tweet that all Muslims "must be held responsible" for the Paris attack.  &#10;&#10;President Francois Hollande in a ceremony honouring the three fallen police officers appropriately expressed the sentiments of many stating, "France is at war against terrorism, jihadism, radicalism. France is not at war against Islam and Muslims".  &#10;&#10;However, Charlie Hebdo's new cover will complicate matters further and in a short period will sideline many Muslims at a critical time in this global struggle against terrorism.  &#10;&#10;Charlie Hebdo and the press have the right to publish what they like but Muslims are free to be offended by what is published and it is their right to be critical of such depictions.  &#10;&#10;No one should tell Muslims what they should or shouldn't get offended by as it is up to them to determine it for their community.  &#10;&#10;By depicting the prophet in a cartoon drawing, Charlie Hebdo chose racism and Islamophobic discourse against all Muslims.  &#10;&#10;This action transformed the discussion from one focused on terrorism, jihadism and murder into a narrow theological and legal debate concerning what can and can't be represented in images about the prophet. This is an issue involving all Muslims not only the terrorists.  &#10;&#10;Another wasted opportunity to build on unity and bring Muslims into the global fold but Charlie Hebdo's editors chose to stay in the mud of racism and Islamophobia. Some argued that they had no choice and they needed to stay true to who they are by printing such a cartoon; however this would be even more the case that the terrorist forced the subject of the cover rather than the other way around.  &#10;&#10;Freedom of the press proponents will celebrate the release of the new cover and view it as a triumph over terrorism by insulting all Muslims through another racist cartoon depicting the prophet, as a hooked-nose Arab looking man. Let's be clear that the overwhelming majority of Muslims will continue to uphold their tradition that it is impermissible to represent the prophet's likeness in the form of an image, while certainly few had the opinion in the past that it is not prohibited.  &#10;&#10;This will not change anytime soon and it is none of anyone's business other than Muslims to decide on this matter. Charlie Hebdo's cartoon attempted to bring the prophet into the debate around terrorism and Muslim violence, which in my view is a shortsighted strategy to deal with a most serious problem.  &#10;&#10;By selecting the prophet as the site of contestation, Charlie Hebdo took a page from the clash of civilisation advocates and built a cartoon narrative around it. In doing so they joined the coalition with the global Islamophobic industry and neo-conservative network that have been pushing this framing for almost 30 years and for sure since the collapse of the Soviet Union.  &#10;&#10;We are in agreement that the terrorists claimed to act on behalf of Islam and as Malek Merabet stated his brother likewise is a Muslim and defended the newspaper from an ethical and moral ground that I fully believe are informed and grounded in Islam.  &#10;&#10;In deciding to print the new cover poking fun of the prophet's image, Charlie Hebdo sided with the terrorist framing of Islam and not with the Muslim police officer who lost his life defending them and would have been likewise offended by the new publication.  &#10;&#10;I do believe that if Ahmad Merabet were alive today he would still show up at the newspaper to protect the individuals and their freedom to insult his faith while deeply aggrieved by it.  &#10;&#10;In this context, every time that we make the connections between terrorism and Islam we are only validating the terrorist's own epistemic and pushing the 99.99 percent of the Muslims away by insisting to insult the prophet and through it their faith.  &#10;&#10;One can have the freedom to say and do something while understanding the pain that it causes others if it is actually carried out. Today would have been a great day to have a cartoon of Ahmed smiling at the terrorist while defending the newspaper and the cartoonists in the name of his Islam.  &#10;&#10;This is not giving into the terrorist but standing with Muslims in opposing terrorism and by affirming the pain and suffering they experienced as a result of the heinous crime committed in their name.  &#10;&#10;Yet on a deeper level, the terrorist purporting to speak for Islam is a crime in itself, which for many Muslims would be akin to accepting the KKK claims to be the authentic voice of Christianity. By framing the response to the terrorist through an explicit link to Islam, we are granting them the credentials they want and directing more attention to their cause.  &#10;&#10;The proper response should have been to remove their Islamic claims and celebrate and embrace the real Muslim heroes who defended and protected lives at both the Charlie Hebdo offices and the shoppers at the kosher supermarket.  &#10;&#10;Who are we poking fun at? The Muslims as diverse minorities in France living at the margins of society are the object of the satire; not the powerful or the terrorists.  &#10;&#10;It is not the powerful but the powerless that is the object of the laughter. Freedom of speech is not absolute and responsibilities are attached to it and more so when those living at the margins are subject to racism and discrimination.  &#10;&#10;We should defend free speech but doing so while listening to the voice of the voiceless living in our midst and dying for "our" collective right to insult their faith.  	Who is being forgiven - the prophet, the terrorists or devout Muslims?&#10;&#10;

(AP)  &#10;&#10;December 1, 2014: President Barack Obama, center, speaks during his meeting with elected officials, law enforcement officials and community and faith leaders in the Old Executive Office Building on the White House Complex in Washington. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)  &#10;&#10;A recent Quinnipiac poll shows support for illegal immigrants at 48 percent, a historic low. This is what the president’s cynical manipulation of the Hispanic community has delivered: a hardening of American attitudes. The same distancing will likely occur between blacks and whites as the demonstrations over the grand jury decisions in Ferguson and Staten Island roll on.  &#10;&#10;Whereas only recently a sizable majority of blacks and whites declared themselves comfortable with the state of race relations in the country, pictures of looting and the inflammatory rhetoric of self-interested activists like Al Sharpton will inevitably sharpen racial divides. The insistent proclamations from Attorney General Eric Holder that our justice system is biased, and the president’s agreement that the law “feels like it’s being applied in a discriminatory fashion,” do not help.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Today, Obama’s well-honed political tactics of dividing and conquering — so essential to electing a virtual nobody to the Oval Office — have come asunder. The interest groups wooed by the president have begun to turn against him. Some feel betrayed; others understand that their demands have isolated them from their fellow countrymen.  &#10;&#10;The only group still giving the president more than a 50 percent approval rating is voters under 3. For the rest of the poor boobs not caught up in the Obama splinter sweep — they are eager to elect a successor who might look out for them. Turns out, those forgotten folks are actually in the majority, and just voted in a Republican Senate.  &#10;&#10;According to the Quinnipiac poll, 48 percent of voters think immigrants living in the U.S. illegally should be allowed to stay. That’s down from 57 percent last year, and lower than ever.  &#10;&#10;Moreover, some 35 percent of the voting public thinks undocumented aliens should be deported — a record high, and up from 26 percent last year. That’s in spite of insistent hectoring from the White House about the moral imperative of providing a legal path for those who are here illegally.  &#10;&#10;Congratulations, Mr. Obama, for ramping up opposition to immigration reform.  &#10;&#10;How to deal with illegal immigrants is not the only issue on which the nation’s attitudes are hardening. Last August, after the shooting of Michael Brown (but before the grand jury decision in the case), a New York Times/CBS poll surveyed voters on their attitudes about race.  &#10;&#10;Asked whether race relations had improved or soured during President Obama’s time in office, 35 percent of respondents said they had gotten worse, while 52 percent said they had stayed the same. Only 10 percent thought the president had had a positive impact on relations – 8 percent of whites and 17 percent of blacks. That is an impressive underachievement from our first African-American president.  &#10;&#10;Overall, 78 percent of respondents, when asked about “race relations in your community,” said they were “generally good.” That included 82 percent of whites and 73 percent of blacks — a strong vote of confidence, especially from a group that was much less positive about the country as a whole, with only 47 percent saying U.S. race relations were “generally good.”  &#10;&#10;This split suggests that people have absorbed the narrative that our country has a race problem not from their personal experience in their own communities, but from the media or our political leaders.  &#10;&#10;The most compelling aspect of that story line entails racial bias in law enforcement. Many initiatives, from decriminalizing marijuana possession to de-emphasizing tactics like “stop and frisk,” have been promulgated based on the fact that more blacks than whites end up on the wrong side of the law. Holder has even dumbed down school discipline measures, arguing they constitute an example of racial bias.  &#10;&#10;The Manhattan Institute’s Steve Malanga sheds some welcome light on this issue. According to surveys conducted by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics over the past 20 years, the number of confrontations between Americans and the police has declined, as has the use of force by law enforcement officials.  &#10;&#10;Most important, perhaps, is that the declines were recorded not just for whites, but for all races. In 2002, 173,000 African-Americans reported a “use of force”; in 2011, that was down to 130,000.  &#10;&#10;Nearly 83 percent of blacks who were involved in traffic stops (the most numerous encounters) agreed with the statement, “When I was stopped by the police, the officers acted properly.”  &#10;&#10;That figure was up from 78 percent in 2002. As for so-called “street stops,” the Bureau reports, “In 2011, less than 1% of the 241.4 million U.S. residents age 16 or older were involved in a street stop”; further, “no differences were observed in the percentage of non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic populations age 16 or older involved in a street stop.” So much for unfair profiling.  &#10;&#10;Under 3 percent of police encounters involve “street stops” of an involuntary nature; of those stopped (likely not a happy crew), two-thirds said the cops behaved “properly and respectfully.” This review does not suggest a law enforcement community reviled by the African-American community, or the country.  &#10;&#10;President Obama has tried to curry favor with blacks, Hispanics, women, the young and the poor by convincing them that they suffer from injustices, that they are victimized by the one percent, by law enforcement, by corporations or insurers — or by Republicans.  &#10;&#10;Americans aren’t buying it. Increasingly, they see a country victimized by an incompetent president.  &#10;&#10;  	President Obama can’t seem to get it right. The more he tries to cull and&#10;court interest groups, the more he alienates the country and widens the wedges&#10;in our society.&#10;&#10;
094-fromguantanamomontevideohav	aljazeera	Wed, 17 Dec 2014 04:34:37 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/from-guantanamo-montevideo-hav-2014121715813982219.html	Massimo Di Ricco 	From Guantanamo to Montevideo and on to Havana	The news of the Guantanamo detainees' arrival to Uruguay received impressive coverage in international media.  &#10;&#10;Uruguay is the second Latin American country to accept Guantanamo detainees; the first one was El Salvador, which welcomed two Chinese nationals in 2012.  &#10;&#10;The fact that there have been only two countries in Latin America accepting Guantanamo inmates is already particularly extraordinary, given US historical ascendancy on the region. Even US' main allies in the region, Chile and Colombia, rejected US proposals to accept prisoners from Guantanamo, considering the move highly unpopular.  &#10;&#10;Perhaps the spotlight fell on Uruguay as a Guantanamo detainee host because of Mujica's own media popularity over his unusually humble way of life as a world leader, and his progressive public speeches and political agenda.  &#10;&#10;He also managed to get a lot of media attention over the arrival of around forty Syrian refugees in October, although they were few in number compared to the thousands of refugees that neighbouring countries such as Brazil and Argentina have been accepting.  &#10;&#10;The day the detainees landed in Montevideo, Mujica sent an open letter to Uruguayans and Barack Obama. The first sentence reads, "Solidarity is the tenderness of the people", a quote from Pablo Neruda referring to the 1939 exodus of Spanish Republicans escaping fascism to South America.  &#10;&#10;Neruda's words well reflect the main humanitarian goal of the operation, which aims to to reinforce the image of Uruguay as a peacemaker and international reference for humanitarian issues. "Pepe" has the aspiration, before ceding power to Tabare Vazquez at the beginning of 2015, to spread his humanitarian legacy and reinforce his world reputation. Through the well-publicised gesture, Mujica aims to give hope to all those disenchanted people who still think that idealism and ethics in politics are still possible.  &#10;&#10;From a political perspective, Mujica's usual anti-imperialist stance left many in Uruguay astonished that he was willing to do a "favour" to Obama and accept the Guantanamo detainees. It is only in the second part of his open letter that his political goals become apparent.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;Mujica asks, as a gesture of reconciliation for all the American people, for the release of a 70 years-old Puerto Rican independence fighter, along with three Cuban detainees who are part of the group known as the Cuban Five, and whose controversial detention in the late 1990s led to a worldwide campaign for their release.  &#10;&#10;He also asks for the lifting of the "unjust embargo" imposed on "our sister" Cuba.  &#10;&#10;Mujica's plea is reflective of an emerging regional bloc different than the usual "left-leaning" one. It is instead a heterogeneous regional political bloc able to come to terms with ideological differences and to find common ground for regional coexistence in the name of progress.  &#10;&#10;Best example of this is the ongoing peace talks between FARC and the Colombian government in Cuba, with the participation of Chile and Venezuela.  &#10;&#10;Mujica's move, therefore, is not unprecedented. Back in 2009 the late Hugo Chavez hinted at the possibility of accepting Guantanamo detainees in Venezuela and at raising the issue of Cuba's isoluation. Cuba's reintegration into regional life, after decades of US ostracism, represents the main political goal of the bloc and of Mujica humanitarian operation.  &#10;&#10;Therefore, it is not surprise that Jose Miguel Insulza, the Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS) publicly lauded Mujica's move. Although leftist American governments have been particularly at odds with the Washington-based regional organisation, as consequence of the informal exclusion of Cuba under US pressure, Insulza has been working hard to reverse it. Just recently, he said that he hoped both Cuba and the US would attend the next OAS summit planned for April in Panama City.  &#10;&#10;The US is unlikely to release the Cuban political prisoners, but Cuba's unilateral release of Alan Gross after 5 years could be part of a larger swap following Mujica's move.  &#10;&#10;The six Guantanamo detainees will probably be the last ones to be resettled in the region. But their landing in Montevideo made it clear that Latin America is not, and will not be again the US backyard.  	The arrival of Guantanamo detainees in Uruguay boosted Mujica's reputation and&#10;put Cuba back on the regional agenda.&#10;&#10;

We cannot pretend that police brutality in the US and the devaluation of black life that it represents is restricted just to the black experience in the heart of the US empire."  &#10;&#10;The attack on Panama and the massive loss of life and destruction was a harbinger of the lawlessness and aggression that would characterise US policies in the unipolar world of the late 20th and early 21st century.  &#10;&#10;When President Noriega failed to support US efforts to destabilise Nicaragua and had the audacity to publicly defy the US state with his defiant rhetoric, Bush had a perfect opportunity to establish the terms for what he referred to as a new world order of unchecked US power.  &#10;&#10;Panama became a demonstration project to communicate to the nations of the global south that resistance to US hegemony would be met with ferocious violence. The fact that scores of black lives would be lost as part of the demonstration was of no consequence to the policymakers of hegemony.  &#10;&#10;The structures and relations of repression are linked from the centre of the empire to its periphery states.  &#10;&#10;US police forces train police departments throughout the world through programmes such as the International Taskforce Agent Training, (conducted by US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations) including police officers that work in communities like El Chorrillo.  &#10;&#10;The US police forces bring with them their military, interrogation, intimidation and racially biased tactics which involve use of excessive force on civilians. It is also internationally known that police are quicker to use force, shoot and kill black people, the same way that the US is quick to invade smaller countries with less power, because in the scope of the political reality, they matter less.  &#10;&#10;Violence is integral to the project of western colonial capitalist domination from Palestine to Ferguson. "On this 25th anniversary of the US invasion of Panama, we need to remember that the struggle for black liberation is ongoing. US authorities must be made to understand that the value of black life is not determined by the borders that those black bodies find themselves. The destruction in Panama is a reminder to my generation that our demand is not new," says Alicia Garza, National Domestic Workers Special Projects director and cofounder of #BlackLivesMatter.  &#10;&#10;While we remember the victims of the US invasion of Panama, the families of the thousands of victims of US criminality in Panama are still demanding justice and accountability 25 years later. Like the families of Eric Garner and Mike Brown and the victims of police violence in the US, they are part of the long line of victims of US criminality globally.  &#10;&#10;These crimes will continue until the people - black people in particular - are able to build the power necessary to ensure that black lives really matter in the US and across the globe.  	The 25th anniversary of the US invasion of Panama is a reminder that US state&#10;violence is not confined to its borders.&#10;&#10;

That uncertainty is the great gift of a democracy. But what a gap between the ideal of citizens interrogating leaders, to decide whether power should change hands, and the arid long campaign this looks set to become.  &#10;&#10;In response to their difficulty in capturing anybody’s attention, the party strategists have decided that the leaders should mostly try to say much the same thing every day for the next four months.  &#10;&#10;British Future’s state of the nation poll illuminates why that approach might seem to make sense – but also why it won’t be enough. Half the electorate knows who they are voting for and what they think the “big issue” is for the election – with the committed voters of each party differing on whether it is the NHS, the economy or immigration that matters most.  &#10;&#10;The contrast between the certainties of these partisan tribes and the uncertainties of the broader electorate will set the tone of the election year. It’s not just Conservative and Labour voters, but Ukippers too who think their party will be in government – or that Nigel Farage might be prime minister in May.  &#10;&#10;Across the spectrum, those with the strongest views overestimate how many people share them. Overall, the public gives a thumbs-down verdict to every party when asked if they would like them in power.  &#10;&#10;More worryingly, only a quarter of people are confident that Britain will come through the election without the tone of the debate damaging relations between different groups in Britain today. Uncertainty about the democratic outcome is a good thing; uncertainty about whether Britain can handle the election-year debates is not. Both the Conservatives, in omitting immigration from their six priority themes, and Labour in advising canvassers to move the conversation on, have ironically shown that it is possible to get headlines by not talking about immigration.  &#10;&#10;Running scared from the issue simply misunderstands public opinion. Most people want a politics that engages with the pressures brought by immigration and yet secures the benefits too. So our appeal for an open and responsible debate can be made not just to the social conscience of politicians but to their enlightened self-interest too.  &#10;&#10;The new state of the nation findings offer an important reason why we might find more confidence in Britain’s ability to handle the immigration and identity debates. In a polarised “culture war” – between those who don’t understand why everywhere is not like London and those who dislike everything that has changed since the 1950s – there will be no winners, only losers, whether the argument is about immigration, identity or Islam or, indeed, gender and gay rights.  &#10;&#10;Of course, there will be some votes in appeals to either pole of the political spectrum – but no majority victory nor stable governing coalition could be won on the basis of a political offer that fails to appeal beyond a party’s core support.  &#10;&#10;Voters expect our politicians to articulate our disagreements. We know they need to make sure their own supporters do go out and vote. But leadership is also about helping us to find the common ground. Which of them could yet find the voice to engage beyond their own political tribe, to come off the “grid” and do more than put out the line that the script demands?  &#10;&#10;In an uncertain and fractious society, there is a greater appetite for politicians with the confidence to speak to people of different generations, to engage in both the cities and out on the coast, and to reach across class, geography and ethnicity. Will anyone step up to meet that challenge in the next three months? If not, that could still be the voice that much of Britain is waiting to hear.  &#10;&#10;Sunder Katwala is the director of British Future  	Sunder Katwala: The party strategists have decided that the leaders should mostly try to say much the same thing every day
097-generationalchangeuscuba	aljazeera	Sat, 27 Dec 2014 02:33:42 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/generational-change-us-cuba-2014122773423746770.html	Gabriel Gonzalez-Kreisberg	The generational change in US-Cuba relations	The announcement of a new era of relations between the United States and Cuba came as a surprise to many who follow and study the relationship between the two rivals.  &#10;&#10;The old guard of Cuban exiles, led by Senator Marco Rubio, predictably reacted with their usual anger. By contrast, many second generation Cuban Americans and advocates reacted differently - with optimism and hope for change. It is important to understand those reactions to the recent announcement as part of a broader evolution towards new relations between the US and Cuba over 20 years in the making, following fundamental security, economic, and political changes.  &#10;&#10;The end of the Cold War in 1989 spelled change for Latin America, just as it did for the world. For Cuba, it meant the loss of its biggest sponsor, which plunged the island into a five-year economic tailspin, contracted its GDP by 30 to 45 percent, and precipitated a number of changes to Cuban policy and law.  &#10;&#10;Those reforms have accelerated throughout the last decade, including an ongoing plan to unify the island’s dual currency. Cuba has had no choice but to liberalise portions of its economy and European countries have been able to take advantage of those opportunities. In the last two decades, a Cuban economy starved for growth has looked overseas and seen the island more willing to come to agreement regarding foreign presence.  &#10;&#10;The implications of the fall of the Soviet Union were not only economic in nature, but also resulted in a shift in US policy towards Latin America more broadly. In the 20-plus years since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the US has tolerated, or even openly collaborated with, leftist regimes in Venezuela, Bolivia, and Honduras that in another era would have been deliberately undermined, or perhaps overthrown, as in the cases of Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua.  &#10;&#10;The strategic and military calculus of our relationship with Cuba has fundamentally changed. Presidents and Congress no longer have the blanket justification of Cuba as a military threat as they did during the Cold War.  &#10;&#10;For Cuban exiles, 1989 was not so much a watershed moment as an opportunity to continue applying pressure to a failing regime. The Cuban-American lobby continued to promote isolationism, believing that this post-Soviet moment was finally the chance to see a democratic counterrevolution on the island. This belief that isolation would force the collapse of Castro regime restricted policy responses available to the US government and presidential administrations.  &#10;&#10;Changes in the global economic and political relationship with Cuba did not affect US policy and Cuba, for the most part, was excluded from the more moderate and tolerant US foreign policy towards Latin America. Republican presidents and legislators proved to be more punitive towards the island - particularly given their reliance on the Cuban-American lobby for monetary and electoral support in south Florida.  &#10;&#10;Despite a cooling in relations during the late 1990s, due to the shooting down of the two US planes flown by "Brothers to the Rescue", President Bill Clinton eased restrictions on humanitarian aid, broadened the ability to send remittances, increased allowable person-to-person interactions, and resumed direct flights between the countries. President Clinton’s actions were part of a broader government strategy of "constructive engagement", in which the US would actively engage with the Cuban people, but maintain pressure on the government.  &#10;&#10;The new millennium did not bring significant changes in relations as, true to Republican form, President George W Bush maintained the status quo of "constructive engagement". If anything, his administration took a harder line, at times including Cuba in the same paragraph as the "Axis of Evil".  &#10;&#10;However, even as President Bush, Senator Marco Rubio, and conservative Cuban- American legislators continued to push a hard line on Cuba, the profile of the average Cuban American changed. The stereotypical conservative Cuban - still upset, and rightfully so, over the nationalisation of private property and human rights abuses during the revolution - still attempts to dominate political discourse.  &#10;&#10;But a new face of the Cuban American has emerged - young, second-generation children have come of age with the desire to see for themselves the homeland that they have only heard about in stories; and new, post-1989 migrants, who are economic rather than political refugees, have closer personal ties to the island.  &#10;&#10;The election of President Obama and the nomination of Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State signalled a new era with a renewed focus on diplomacy. Four months after taking office, the administration quietly continued to liberalise relations between the US and Cuba. However, Alan Gross' imprisonment in 2009 gave opportunity for the age-old arguments against Cuba to resurface, with the old guard claiming that nothing had changed and seeing it as the latest example of the long history of Cuban aggression.  &#10;&#10;I do not dispute the fact that the Castro brothers have been harsh dictators and that their system of government has deeply damaged multiple generations of Cubans, nor do I dispute that regime change should still be a goal of US policy. However as my analysis has shown, the rest of the story has changed. Cuba's economy continues to search for growth, and the government is actively looking outside the country for investment.  &#10;&#10;Long gone are the existential security threats that came from the island during the Cold War. Moreover, this reflects the changing opinions of Cuban Americans. The new modes of engagement announced by Obama on December 17 were not an acknowledgement of defeat, but an effort for a new way forward that reflects those changes.  &#10;&#10;December 17 will no doubt be an important moment in the lives of Cubans and Cuban Americans, but it deserves more analysis than the knee-jerk reactions on the front pages of newspapers and talk shows in the US. Obama should be commended for basing policy on facts rather than emotions. The US must continue to actively engage with the island, lest we lose the opportunity to influence a neighbour that is gradually rejoining the regional and world economy and political order.  	Regional circumstances have changed, and so have attitudes among US&#10;policymakers and Cuban Americans towards Cuba.&#10;&#10;
098-germanyforceforgoodintodayseur	guardian	2015-01-11T09:29:26Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/11/germany-force-for-good-in-todays-europe	Will Hutton	Germany: a beacon and a force for good in Europe	We are lucky to have today’s Germany. When Chancellor Merkel arrived in London last week, she came as the accomplished leader of Europe’s most successful liberal democracy. Germany’s economic strength is taken for granted; more subtly, we also take for granted that this is an essentially good country. It is not going to assuage any demons by behaving aggressively to its neighbours or blaming foreigners for any of its problems. It is quietly and determinedly going to attempt to anchor Europe in the same successful combination of liberal democracy, social solidarity and productive capitalism that it enjoys – and it has the economic and moral wherewithal to do just that.  &#10;&#10;This very new country – after all German reunification was completed just 25 years ago – could be so different. It could have a poisonous political movement aiming to restore Napoleonic glories riding high in the polls – see the Front National in France. It could be captured by venal, vested-interest groups locking the economy in permanent stagnation like Italy. It could be in thrall to a know-nothing political right whose objective is to run the country in the interests of its top 1% like the US’s Republicans. It could be led by a self-regarding nationalist such as Russia’s Mr Putin. It could live in a cultural time-warp like today’s Britain, hankering to restore the lost certainties of the 1950s.  &#10;&#10;Germany is none of those things. If it were, Europe would be fundamentally and worryingly unstable. Rather, this is a firmly liberal democratic country looking forward in the 21st century because its relationship to history, as director of the British Museum Neil MacGregor argues in his revelatory and illuminating book Germany, compels it never to look back. Germany can only face its otherwise unintelligible historical crimes, genocide and futile millions of war dead with a resolve to never again make the same mistakes. Its capital city, Berlin, forces its citizens every day to confront the fact that it exterminated six million Jews in its striking Holocaust memorial; no other world capital so uncompromisingly has built monuments at its heart to force it constantly to confront past disasters.  &#10;&#10;What does it mean to be us is a question every country asks, searching its history to reproduce whatever success it might have once enjoyed. MacGregor’s argument is that because Germany cannot take comfort or define itself by imagined past glories, it is free of imprisoning and destructive myths. It has become, of necessity, a force for good, too little recognised in Britain in part because we still define ourselves as a victor over Germany when it was evil. Angela Merkel chose to spend some hours of her time in London visiting the Germany exhibition at the British Museum, an exhibition MacGregor has curated alongside his book. MacGregor believes Britain does not understand today’s Germany, the complexities that delivered it or why it thinks as it does. Merkel agrees. The point of her British trip was not to devise ways of helping Cameron win his EU referendum in 2017, about which she was stubbornly reticent. It was very publicly to endorse MacGregor’s view of today’s Germany before his exhibition closes later this month – and perhaps trigger a different debate.  &#10;&#10;MacGregor organises the exhibition so that the first big quote you see is Goethe and Schiller’s 1796 declaration: “Germany? Where is it?/ I do not know where to find such a country.” There are eight different maps of ever-mutating German territory since 1500. Thus the home of Immanuel Kant, its greatest philosopher, is Kalingrad (then Königsberg) which is now in Russia; the city that most influenced its greatest poet (Goethe), Strasbourg, is now in France. From 1500 to 1806, “German-ness” expressed itself through the loose association of principalities, cities, dukedoms and minor states that was the shifting boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire until its defeat by Napoleon. Then came the nation state that was first imperial and then Hitler’s Germany. Postwar division followed defeat, then reunification.  &#10;&#10;For Germany, the nation state has been an aberrant, destructive interlude between the Holy Roman Empire and now the European Union – a 21st-century variant of the Holy Roman Empire, but with a single currency, market and trading rules. For Germany, it is the only way to conceive of the future, and create a peaceful and productive Europe. Senior German officials talk privately in these terms, categories that bewilder the British still locked in fundamentally traditional political categories. For its neighbours, one downside of Germany’s recent past – 1920s hyperinflation – is its quasi- religious attachment to sound money and budgetary rectitude. But the greater German attachment, trumping everything, is to think and build forward recognising today’s realities.  &#10;&#10;Thus the Greek political crisis – and the possible confrontation between Germany and the anti-austerity Greek left if it wins the elections – may have a happier outcome than the British consensus could ever imagine. Syriza has the 30 super-rich Greek families that pay no tax and run Greece as a payola for their own interests in its sights as much as it is targeting Greece’s suffocating external debt burden and excess of austerity. It is also keenly aware that abandoning the euro for the drachma and detaching itself from the EU exposes Greece to both huge inflation and the tender mercies of Turkey.  &#10;&#10;The potential deal with Germany is clear. The left will forge a proper liberal Greek democracy with the 30 families paying tax, secure the forgiveness of much of its external debt but stay in the euro: the price will be that it continues with tough constraints on public spending.  &#10;&#10;As France is shaken to its core by recent events, Germany will want to see the atrocities as the acts of a murderous cult fuelled by marginalisation rather than join in any putative clash of civilisations. It knows better than any other European country where that leads: why it will successfully handle its own backlash against Islam, Pegida. Equally, if there is a British referendum on EU membership, Germany will offer whatever British government the deal necessary to keep Britain in.  &#10;&#10;Its mission is to try to hold Europe together, keeping at bay the temptations of Islamophobia, nativism, political extremism and protectionism. It may not succeed. But imagine if it did not try or if Germany itself gave in to the same temptations. It would love Britain to recall that at different times it has fought alongside Germans, to drop its fixation with two world wars and now make common cause to build a great future. Europe would be so much stronger if we dared.  	Will Hutton: Angela Merkel’s country is quietly attempting to anchor the EU in the liberal democracy and productive capitalismit enjoys
099-gpsobesepatientsweightlossadvi	guardian	2015-01-14T13:13:39Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/14/gps-obese-patients-weight-loss-advice	Ann Robinson	It may be awkward, but GPs owe it to obese patients to give weight loss advice	According to a study by researchers at King’s College London, many doctors are failing to tackle their patients’ weight problems. Researchers analysed the records of several thousand obese patients and found that 80% of them had never talked to their GP about their weight. This finding comes in the same week as it was reported that diabetes, an obesity-related disease, is using up a tenth of the NHS budget and causing record numbers of complications.  &#10;&#10;But is fat a medical issue? Should nurses and GPs like me broach the subject? And does intervention ever work? Some argue that obesity is a symptom of poverty and should be tackled at source. But while government, schools and other agencies clearly have a role to play, I don’t see how GPs can ignore obesity when faced with it. There is no doubt that the 22% of men and 24% of women in the UK who are obese are at increased risk of several cancers, heart, liver and respiratory disease, dementia and diabetes.  &#10;&#10;As a busy GP faced with an overflowing waiting room of ill people, it’s tempting to avoid bringing up the subject. I have to pick the right moment and phrase it sensitively: “Do you feel your weight is an issue?” and “Is there something we can do to help?” are good openers, but there needs to be time to have the discussion. I admit I often put it off. But, arguably, one obese person referred for life-changing bariatric surgery is a more useful intervention than seeing a room full of people with coughs and colds.  &#10;&#10;Not everyone is receptive. Some say “I’m overweight but I am fitter than most people my age”. Or “I know lots of thin people who have died young and fat people who are fine”. But these comments are the same as anecdotal tales of smokers who live to 100 and young non-smokers who die of lung cancer. We are talking about increased risk, not a guaranteed death sentence if you’re obese or smoke and certain immortality if you’re thin or a non-smoker. This sounds obvious, but it’s funny how irrational many people are, especially if you’re telling them something they don’t want to hear.  &#10;&#10;I think GPs have a responsibility to initiate a conversation about obesity because it is clear that it is an important health risk, overweight people often underestimate their weight, losing weight can reduce that risk, and there are interventions that can help. For example, bariatric surgery, which is arguably the most effective way of keeping weight off, may cut the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 80%.  &#10;&#10;We also owe it to the next generation to intervene. Most fat children have fat parents, and most will become fat adults in turn. More than half of obese six- year-olds will become obese adults, compared with less than 10% of non-obese kids. And having an obese parent doubles your risk of being an obese adult, even if you’re a skinny child. So any intervention that helps a parent to tackle their obesity is likely to have a positive impact on the adults of the future.  &#10;&#10;There is no need for doctors to be nihilistic and think it’s not worth broaching the subject because nothing can be done. True, we don’t know the most effective way of tackling obesity yet, and Europe-wide trials are ongoing to try to find out what that would be. But there are options available: local council-run exercise programmes; referral to an NHS dietician; the prescription drug orlistat; or referral for bariatric surgery. Last month, a new anti-obesity drug, Mysimba, was approved by the European Medicines Agency, and is likely to be available on prescription later this year, despite the reservations of some experts.  &#10;&#10;There will be some GP consultations in which discussion about obesity just isn’t appropriate or relevant. If a person is devastated by a recent bereavement, for instance, it may be rude, crass, insensitive and offensive to mention their weight. And having discussed the subject, there is no need to bang on about it at every visit. But putting it off forever is an abrogation of a doctor’s duty of care. A person may choose not to take up the doctor’s offer to explore the problem; that’s their right of course. But there’s no excuse for not offering.  	Ann Robinson: I know from experience that for a doctor to avoid a conversation about obesity is a failure of care
100-greecesuffereuroexitsinglecurr	guardian	2015-01-09T13:42:13Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/09/greece-suffer-euro-exit-single-currency-resilient	Katinka Barysch	A Greek euro exit would hurt Europe – but not as much as it would hurt Greece	When the people of Greece go to the polls on 25 January, they will face some fairly fundamental choices. Contrary to what many politicians and commentators would have you believe, this election is not about whether Greeks want to stay in the euro – a majority clearly wants to. The real question is whether this latest turn in the drama will finally force Greek politicians to act in their country’s long-term interest.  &#10;&#10;Opinion polls suggest that Greek voters oscillate between anger and fear: anger about the enormous costs they have had to bear in the course of the adjustment programme; and fear of what would happen if Alexis Tsipras, head of the hard-left Syriza movement that still leads in the polls, tries to force through another cut in Greece’s international debt.  &#10;&#10;In the last debt restructuring in 2012, the creditors already promised to help Greece reduce its debt to more sustainable levels by 2020 – provided Athens continues to improve its budget. The Greeks have a democratic right to elect a leader who wants to tear up this agreement; just as Germans, Dutch, Finns and others have a right to elect governments that insist on such deals being adhered to. Although Tsipras says he does not want to leave the euro, the resulting showdown could force Greece out of the single currency.  &#10;&#10;Today, the spectre of “Grexit” is more threatening to the Greeks than to the rest of Europe. Reforms in Spain, Portugal and Ireland have made these countries more resilient. International rescue funds and the European Central Bank stand ready to help in case panic should nevertheless spread. Five out of Germany’s eight leading economic research institutes think the eurozone could now cope with a Greek exit.  &#10;&#10;This does not mean, however, that Germany or the other eurozone countries want Greece to leave. Even if contagion was limited, another worsening of the eurozone crisis would undermine confidence, stunt the region’s fragile recovery and make Europe’s leaders – many of whom have declared the crisis over – look inept. The political and economic consequences for other European countries would be severe.  &#10;&#10;Therefore, even if the rest of Europe does not want to be blackmailed, it will likely be ready to talk. The new Greek government, whether it is led by the incumbent premier Antonis Samaras, Tsipras, or a new coalition, could reasonably demand a new grand bargain under which the ECB-IMF-EC troika of lenders agrees to revisit the debt issue while the Greek government promises to make the economy fit for the future.  &#10;&#10;Economic reform, however, is hardly what Greek politicians are talking about in this election campaign. Greek voters face the unenviable choice between re- electing the mainstream politicians who landed Greece in its current mess in the first place, or voting for Tsipras or other populists who make unrealistic promises of higher wages and more security. The trouble is not that Tsipras is radical; it is that he is not radical enough. By promising state handouts to voters and protection for vested interests, he is perpetuating the dysfunctional system that plunged Greece into crisis.  &#10;&#10;Over the past few years, the ruling coalition between the two established parties has tried a tricky balancing act of preserving the system of bureaucratic cronyism that since the 1970s they have helped to build, and modernising Greece’s state and economy, as promised to international lenders. The result was an often agonisingly slow process of to and fro, with troika officials regularly departing in frustration about Greek foot-dragging.  &#10;&#10;It is not only the troika’s emphasis on austerity that has caused the Greek people so much pain. As important was that huge adjustments were foisted upon an extraordinarily rigid economy. Despite much effort to open up mollycoddled sectors since 2010, Greece is still one of Europe’s most overregulated economies. Sluggish bureaucracies and exaggerated form-filling are the main reason Greece’s exports have not rebounded like those of Spain, Portugal and Ireland. The absence of a reliable land registry is holding back investment. An unreformed social security system still benefits better-off households more than the destitute. While the tax burden on ordinary people has risen, wealthy individuals and companies can still often evade their dues. And wages in the public sector have fallen – but nowhere near as fast as those in the private sector, despite starting from a much higher level.  &#10;&#10;Greek politicians must get serious about removing the shackles from the economy.  &#10;&#10;Economists think the benefits of structural reforms could materialise quickly in Greece’s inefficient economy, and would be substantial. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that Greek businesses could save hundreds of millions of euros a year if the government scrapped burdensome regulations. The Greek thinktank IOBE calculates that improvements to the business and investment environment could lift GDP by more than 2% in just two years, while steps to increase competition in industries and services would have an even bigger impact.  &#10;&#10;Greece has started building a sounder economy on the wreckage of a public sector bubble and a strangulated private sector. The costs have been exorbitant. It would be a real Greek tragedy if the country’s next government squandered the potential gains and reversed the process.

Obama talking to YouTube stars right move?	  &#10;&#10;If there\'s one thing this administration is really good at -- its messaging -- specifically to millennials in 2008 and 2012.  &#10;&#10;Yes. Any political candidate thinking about becoming president in 2016 will need to figure out how to take advantage of all internet and social media avenues to maximize their exposure in every place possible. Is going to YouTube stars after something as important as the State of the Union the right move? I don\'t think it would have been that big of a deal -- if -- he had also mixed in a few more serious interviews along with it. We live in serious times.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;We can\'t just turn a blind eye and take a selfie and pretend everything is a-ok. Especially when there will apparently not be any photo of the president with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he comes to dc in early march.  &#10;&#10;Having said that -- hats off to Bethany Mota, Hank Green and Glozell green for using their smarts to come up with YouTube videos that have attracted millions of hits. And now --- taking an interest in politics! As Bethany readily admitted ... "before I came here to do this interview for YouTube, I never really followed politics that much." can we hope now more people will be more politically informed?  &#10;&#10;Gretchen Carlson currently serves as anchor of FOX News Channel\'s (FNC) The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson (weekdays 2-3PM/ET).

The piece illustrated a vivid picture of human resilience after over a decade of extreme privation and suffering.  &#10;&#10;As inspirational as they were, the photographs also served as a stark contrast to the daily realities experienced by the former inmates during the course of their detention - realities still experienced by the 127 men still held there.  &#10;&#10;On Guantanamo's 13th anniversary, the US government must continue to work diligently without any more excuses to ensure due process for the remaining detainees and shut down one of the darkest holdovers from the "war on terror".  &#10;&#10;Glimmer of hope  &#10;&#10;In a joint declaration issued last year by the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, several other UN agencies and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), the US was urged to "adopt all legislative, administrative, judicial, and any other types of measures necessary to prosecute, with full respect for the right to due process, the individuals being held at Guantanamo Naval Base or, where applicable, to provide for their immediate release or transfer to a third country".  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;Yet, of the total of 779 men and boys that have been detained at Guantanamo Bay since 2002, only nine have been convicted of any crime. Of the 127 remaining detainees, 59 have been unanimously cleared by US intelligence and security agencies, of any involvement in terrorism but continue to await their release. The remaining 68 inmates are classified as "indefinite detainees", a Kafka-esque category used for detainees ineligible for either trial or release.  &#10;&#10;These men will face Periodic Review Board hearings, an incipient interagency process that will assess whether an inmate poses a threat to the US or is eligible for transfer. However, this procedure lacks guarantees to due process and will likely prolong situations of arbitrary detention.  &#10;&#10;Moreover, as inmate transfers continue, the US must abide by the principle of "non-refoulement", ensuring detainees' right to not be returned to a place where they will face persecution, torture or death.  &#10;&#10;This guarantee was not upheld with cleared inmate and Centre for Justice and International Law and Centre for Constitutional Rights' client Djamel Ameziane, who was forcibly repatriated back to his birth country of Algeria despite stated fears of persecution and standing precautionary measures ordered in his favour.  &#10;&#10;Upon his return, Ameziane was detained by Algerian government agents as part of an "evaluation process" and subjected to abuses that left him in poor health.  &#10;&#10;Ameziane's forcible repatriation is only one of several other cases. In 2014, two other men were involuntarily repatriated to Libya and, in 2007, two others were sent back to Tunisia.  &#10;&#10;Resettling detainees back to countries that will expose them and their families to threats, persecution, and - in the case of detainees who are not cleared - to ongoing detention and torture, will only deepen years of suffering and injustice.  &#10;&#10;The US Senate committee's grisly report on the CIA's interrogation methods and the trickling repatriation of cleared inmates represent important steps towards making the truth of the "war on terror" available to the public. However, the question over how material and intellectual authors of torture will be held accountable in accordance with international law remains.  &#10;&#10;As party to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the US is not only forbidden from practising torture but required to prevent and hold accountable any individuals who are involved in these particular kinds of human rights violations. Under this convention, US federal authorities are required to conduct "prompt and impartial investigations" of these crimes.  &#10;&#10;Additionally, under the Common Article Three of the Geneva Convention - the article which bars torture, cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment against prisoners of war - the US could be held accountable for war crimes.  &#10;&#10;Finally, under international law, amnesty laws are not permitted and the authors of torture must be prosecuted - at home or abroad.  &#10;&#10;The public availability of documentation to establish the truth behind Guantanamo Bay will no doubt play a pivotal role in dismantling the architecture of state-sanctioned human rights abuses.  &#10;&#10;While the US Senate's scathing report revealed some of the most shocking instances of torture, its 6,700 pages are the tip of the iceberg.  &#10;&#10;In early December, a US judge ordered the disclosure of over 30 tapes depicting the controversial nasogastric force-feedings of hunger strikers in Guantanamo, including Abu Wael Dhiab - one of the six men released to Uruguay. While attempts are being made by the Obama administration to overturn the ruling, human rights groups continue to demand for release of the tapes.  &#10;&#10;Almost six years after US President Barack Obama signed an executive order to shut down Guantanamo Bay, it is unfathomable that this international symbol for US human rights abuses remains open. The ongoing reluctance to punish those responsible for authorising and using torture is even more unfortunate.  &#10;&#10;Yet, now more than ever, the US government can send a powerful message stating that no one is exempt from international accountability and prosecution. What is done now will start to ensure that torture - or "Enhanced Interrogation Techniques" - are never used by the US or other military and intelligence personnel in situations of conflict.  &#10;&#10;By promoting the pursuit of truth and justice, the US will finally be able to close one of the grimmest chapters in its history.  	Recent inmate transfers offer a glimmer of hope but there is still much work&#10;to be done.&#10;&#10;
103-guardianviewcirclehinchingbroo	guardian	2015-01-09T19:18:08Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/09/guardian-view-circle-hinchingbrooke-failure-casts-shadow-whole-tory-agenda	Editorial	The Guardian view on Circle and Hinchingbrooke: a failure that casts a shadow over the whole Tory agenda	The first thing to say about the collapse of Circle’s pioneering contract to manage Hinchingbrooke district hospital in Cambridgeshire is that it must be desperately worrying for patients and staff alike. Even though the Care Quality Commission found that the hospital was “inadequate” across the board, including care and safety – which probably precipitated Circle’s decision to pull out – uncertainty allied with ill health is a terrible combination. NHS England, and the Department of Health, have a heavy burden of responsibility over the coming days to restore confidence and clarify what happens next.  &#10;&#10;The second point is that it is a political catastrophe for the Conservatives – although the process of privatisation began on Labour’s watch – all the worse for coinciding with ever grimmer news on waiting times at accident and emergency departments in England. The cost and disruption of the Lansley reforms must bear some responsibility for the worst winter crisis ever. Hinchingbrooke’s failure surely torpedoes any immediate prospects of a big expansion of privatisation. It looks like a clear victory for all those who have repeatedly warned that privatisation and profits are incompatible with a free, universal healthcare system. It could be Tweeted as Goldman Sachs (training ground of Ali Parsa, Circle’s former chief executive), nil, NHS, one.  &#10;&#10;The truth is more complex. Circle won the contract in a process of franchising out Hinchingbrooke hospital management at least partly because no NHS bidder thought the sums could be made to add up. Hinchingbrooke, which sits almost equidistant between major hospitals in Cambridge to the south and Peterborough to the north, is a hospital that has needed downsizing or even closing for the last 20 years. Now Circle is pulling out, less than a third of the way through a 10-year contract, reportedly £7m poorer and with a stock price that has taken a double-digit hit in the past 24 hours, surely confirmation that privatisation delivers no magical solution. Circle’s obligations included paying down a debt of £40m, accrued over just three years, within the next 10. The heroic scale of that commitment was laid bare in a National Audit Office report in 2013, which showed that Circle would have to deliver £30m of savings every year. Only months after the start of the contract in February 2012, it was clear the hospital was well behind its savings target. Although care improved, it was clear the financial plan wasn’t working. Mr Parsa stood down as chief executive of Circle. By the end of its second financial year, the deficit was just short of £5m, the point at which Circle could pull out. MPs on the public accounts committee have questioned how the contract came to be awarded at all. Part of the answer is that it was clear an NHS solution was not on the cards: it would have taken more cash than was available post-crash. But there’s a lesson in the way contracts are awarded too. At least one study suggests a lack of expertise in Whitehall means that contracts go to the shiniest rather than the most competent contender.  &#10;&#10;Circle complains that it wasn’t in control of the environment in which it worked. Like every hospital trust, it struggled under new treatment tariffs, the Nicholson challenge to make £20bn of savings over a five-year period, and fluctuating demand influenced partly by GP and community care availability. The Lansley reforms have set up a competitive relationship between the new care commissioning groups and providers such as Hinchingbrooke, unforeseen when the contract was agreed. The process of winding up the Circle franchise and bringing the hospital back into NHS management will lay bare the weaknesses of the new structures, the lack of any proper local accountability and the inability to reorganise services on a coherent, holistic basis.  &#10;&#10;The impact of complexity, centralisation and cost-cutting are now graven on the statistics. The figures published today show that every aspect of A&E; care – not just waiting times, but delayed ambulances, ambulances waiting to transfer patients, and patients waiting to be transferred out of A&E; – are the worst on record. The Conservative vision for the future of the NHS is looking like an electoral liability.

The EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said: “The threat is not only the one we faced in Paris, but it is spreading in other parts of the world, starting from Muslim countries.”  &#10;&#10;Better coordination is undoubtedly needed to foil further attacks in Europe, where Islamist terrorists have struck in three capitals – Madrid, London and now Paris. Anti-terrorism raids in France and Belgium confirm that the threat continues. The Paris killers had links with networks across the Middle East, including in Yemen. So the need to share intelligence to counter groups that themselves operate and communicate easily across borders cannot be disputed. A further illustration of this came when an Algerian national appeared before a Greek prosecutor on Monday over a possible link to a foiled Islamist plot to attack police in Belgium.  &#10;&#10;It is logical for Europe to reach out to Arab countries. The first victims of violent jihadism are, after all, to be found in the Arab world. In the Middle East and north Africa, terrorists have targeted Muslims first and foremost. It came as little surprise that the Arab League secretary general, Nabil el-Araby – who has recently met Ms Mogherini – immediately declared his organisation’s readiness to help European partners in dealing with a danger that spans many regions.  &#10;&#10;It is, nevertheless, vital that such cooperation avoids the mistakes of the past. This is not a war of civilisations. It is a fight against a violent sectarian ideology that finds breeding grounds in Europe’s disenfranchised communities and in the killing fields of the Middle East. Ms Mogherini is correct to state that this is “not an issue between Europe or the west and Islam”. But this effort must give proper priority to precautions and standards that have, in the past, been all too often trampled upon.  &#10;&#10;The global war on terror proclaimed in the aftermath of 9/11 involved measures that violated fundamental rights and international law. Western cooperation with repressive Arab states involved rendition flights and the outsourcing of torture. Many regimes used repressive methods and emergency legislation to crush dissent as much as to track terrorists. Last month this system of abuses was detailed in the damning US Senate report on the secret CIA programme that ran detention sites and organised the transfer of detainees with the cooperation of partner countries, some of which were in the Arab and Muslim world.  &#10;&#10;Calling for an alliance between Europe and Arab countries in a renewed fight against terrorism is important. But it should not permit any amnesia about where this has led in the past decade. In the Middle East and north Africa, many regimes continue to show complete disregard for basic human rights and legal procedures – as the recent flogging of a Saudi blogger has illustrated. Only one country, Tunisia, can claim to have reached some form of stable democracy in the wake of the Arab spring. Others are run by despots or by military juntas, as in Egypt, or have been caught in a spiral of anarchy, as in Libya. Human rights activists and civil society struggle to do their work under immense pressure. There are few checks and balances. Nor is there sufficient oversight of security forces conducting anti-terrorism efforts.  &#10;&#10;So, as Europeans reach out to these regimes, they must beware of the pitfalls. An alliance with authoritarian powers, made blindly or naively, can too easily involve the abandonment of values, a dangerous sense of impunity and even indifference towards the worst abuses. It can also backfire, because repression in some Arab states has provoked fresh discontent and radicalisation. All these things have happened in recent years. This time, therefore, Europe must rigorously uphold its standards as it embarks on this new era of cooperation. This time, the price of mutual assistance must not be a blind eye or a guilty silence about unacceptable abuses.

The question is what that significance is. There are almost as many interpretations of the demise of the daily topless model as there are voices in the debate that has raged since it emerged via the Sun’s stablemate, the Times, that she has gone. The future is clothed, slightly, and if Tuesday’s Sun is any guide, loping along a beach somewhere sunny.  &#10;&#10;It might be taken as just another typically astute commercial judgment by the Sun’s ultimate proprietor, Rupert Murdoch, who tweeted last September that he thought Page 3 was out of date. It might be part of the smartening up that’s followed the phone-hacking scandal, or it might be more evidence of the newspaper’s brilliant ability to reflect its readership’s changing perceptions back at them.  &#10;&#10;On the nuttier fringes of the conversation are those who claim to believe it will come to be seen as the first move in a new oppression which will end only when wearing the burqa becomes obligatory. A handful of others believe that the last symbol of the objectification of women has finally been extinguished. The truth is simpler. The mighty Sun has, despite all its protestations, been defeated by one small but core concern of feminism. Exploitative images of women have no place in a newspaper. Their disappearance is a recognition that ways of seeing are changing.  &#10;&#10;It may seem misjudged to herald the disappearance of the Page 3 girl as a victory when pornography is probably more easily available than at any time in history. Yet this is a fight that will be won skirmish by skirmish, and the fight against Page 3 has been more than a skirmish. It matters because this is not some small elitist publication but Britain’s biggest-selling newspaper. It matters because it was made to matter through the efforts of brave and resolute women like Clare Short and Harriet Harman, campaigning unflinchingly through 40 long years of sneering and jeering to make people see why it is an outrage in a society that purports to believe in equality between the sexes. It matters because – even when it is subsitituted, as the Sun intends, with more images of airbrushed beauty – it is a reminder to girls worrying about the gap between their own body and some version of perfection that there is an alternative view. It matters because it means that it is now generally recognised that pictures objectifying women – even when she is a willing partner in the objectification – are demeaning and damaging to wider society.  &#10;&#10;But there are many things that the disappearance of Page 3 is not. It is not the end of the battle to end gender discrimination, a battle with a distance to go on every front, from pay and employment to the portrayal of women in the media. Pragmatists will point out that the Page 3 girl has after all not gone, merely been locked behind a paywall, currency in the Sun’s contest with the Daily Mail and its sidebar of shame, where semi-clothed celebrities are held up for ridicule. Getting the bikini top put on is a victory. But only a small one.  	Editorial: The disappearance of the Sun’s daily topless model feature is but a skirmish won in the battle against gender discrimination, although one that matters

That’s not only been the way to make money over the past six months but also the terms in which the current slide in the price of oil is discussed. But the effect on this stock or that currency could be as nothing compared to the eventual effect on the resources of nature.  &#10;&#10;The gloop that lubricates industrial life can remake the weather in various ways. Most obviously, cheaper energy prices (many of which are still linked to the cost of crude) will incrementally increase the temptation to fritter away precious power – to leave the car engine idling, or to fail to go upstairs to switch off that light. Little habits matter, because, with the clock ticking remorselessly down towards climate catastrophe, every little hurts. How much damage the great oil crash will do here depends what happens next. In the past, the world has been stunned not only by the waning but also the waxing of the price. If what comes down soon goes back up, such direct effects may not prove so profound.  &#10;&#10;What will matter more in the longer term is the dynamic effect on the energy infrastructure. For both good and ill, cheap oil disincentivises investment in change. On the plus side, the most exploitative schemes to extract ever more fossil fuels become less economic. Already, oil companies are reviewing a planned $1 trillion in ventures, such as deep-sea drilling, that no longer make economic sense. If oil’s depression continues, marginal fracking projects could be extinguished. All this is helpful in terms of the burning question about how the world can agree to leave half of its coal, gas and oil underground, as it will have to if the world is to keep a lid on the warming.  &#10;&#10;But at the same time cheap oil weakens market forces that might otherwise rein in energy use. The expectation that fossil fuels would get scarcer and pricier has forced capitalism to take investment in energy efficiency seriously. Manufacturers of electric cars and green fridges could get cold feet, and there could likewise be an unravelling of the logic of developing renewable energy, which only stacks up when the power that it generates is less costly than carbon-based energy. That’s not a sum that works in favour of renewables in a free-market $50-a-barrel world.  &#10;&#10;But if the free market is doing less work in rationing carbon, that means government must do more. The politics of fixing climate have often proved horrendous, but there really ought to be a new opportunity now to do a few overdue things. Emerging economies must call time on ruinous energy subsidies that local industries now unexpectedly have less need for. Cheaper oil means it’s more necessary than ever that the US should follow Europe and regulate for leaner engines. And Britain should look again at tax. As oil prices rose, the chancellor made great play of freezing fuel duties, while also promising a “stabilising” rise in duties when pump prices fell. Now that they have, the stabiliser is being abandoned – a destabilising move from an administration whose claim to be the greenest government ever has slowly become a hollow joke.  	Editorial: With cheaper crude, markets will do even less than before to ration carbon – so governments must do much more
107-guardianviewontalksangelamerke	guardian	2015-01-06T19:27:27Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/06/guardian-view-on-talks-angela-merkel-david-cameron	Editorial	The Guardian view on talks between Angela Merkel and David Cameron	If politics were like boxing, meetings between national leaders would be arranged according to weight. In the asymmetrical world of international relations, however, disparity is the norm rather than the exception. So it is with Angela Merkel and David Cameron, who confer together in London on Wednesday. The chancellor is the heavyweight contender, while the prime minister would rate as middleweight at most. The difference, unfortunately, is not just a reflection of the strength and size of the two countries concerned. It is also a measure of the stature of these two politicians.  &#10;&#10;Mrs Merkel’s characteristics – her steadiness, her careful thinking through of problems, her solid control of her party, her reluctance to move until she is sure of the right course, her refusal to play to the gallery – enhance Germany’s influence in Europe and the world. With Mr Cameron, the reverse is true. He has charm and a certain decency, but he is too easily blown off course by adverse winds arising within his own party and outside it. This has led him to take positions on Europe and immigration that could have been expressly designed to reduce our influence on our neighbours, ones that could lead to Britain departing the European Union. That would leave the United Kingdom in an isolation which it can be guessed Mr Cameron does not want but which he could nevertheless end up having brought about.  &#10;&#10;So it is that, as our former Berlin correspondent argues, he looks to Germany for rescue, hoping that Mrs Merkel’s government will help craft changes in European regulations that Mr Cameron will then be able to present to his own party and to voters attracted by Ukip’s nostrums as helping Britain control the flow of immigrants. Whether such changes actually would have that effect in any longer term is another matter. Mr Cameron may not care too much about that, wanting only the appearance of concessions to help him out of the political corner into which he has painted himself. Contrast Mrs Merkel’s forthright remarks on the anti-Islamic demonstrations with which Germany is currently coping, with Mr Cameron’s skirting of the moral aspects of the immigration debate to see the difference.  &#10;&#10;Mrs Merkel has to manage a crammed portfolio of European problems. Britain’s difficulties are not at the top of the heap. The most important general issue she faces is whether to stick with an unalloyed austerity programme that is becoming more and more politically explosive in southern Europe. The most immediate specific question is how to cope with a possible change of government in Greece. A more fundamental problem, in terms of the dynamics of the union, is how to prop up the old partnership with France. And the most obvious external problem is how to manage Ukraine and Russia. Here, at least, Britain and Germany seem to be on the same page.  &#10;&#10;Mrs Merkel is the strongest and most important leader in Europe. She is hardly beyond reproach. The contradiction in her position is that at home she essentially governs as a social democrat, yet she operates as a neoliberal hawk abroad. Her austerity drive can be said, at the very least, to be causing as many problems as it solves. Her insistence on reform in Greece is vague when it should be detailed, leading to the suspicion that the problem is that, in German eyes, Greece can do nothing right.  &#10;&#10;Domestically, she often manages to “solve” political problems by simply sitting them out, while her parliamentarians squabble and everyone gets bored of the subject and moves on. That is how she dealt with the scandal of the NSA monitoring her mobile phone: she largely kept quiet when many were hoping that she would raise her voice more loudly. But in broader foreign policy matters, that is not a working strategy in the long run. Her dealings with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin over the past year show signs of a learning curve: she has been not just quiet but quietly firm. The world is still waiting for her to show similar leadership in the eurozone crisis.  &#10;&#10;But at least she is in a position to do so. Mr Cameron, however, has all but written himself out of the European script. He is not a problem-solver, as Mrs Merkel is or could be, but a problem in himself for Europe, and yet another cross for the chancellor to bear.  	Editorial: Britain is just another problem for a harassed German chancellor to take on
108-guardianviewsurveillanceafterp	guardian	2015-01-09T20:34:51Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/09/guardian-view-surveillance-after-paris	Editorial	The Guardian view on surveillance after Paris	With two hostage crises playing out in parallel, one given an especially sinister dimension by the targeting of a kosher supermarket, today’s pictures from Paris underlined a jihadi threat that is ugly and real. Before the standoffs reached their bloody climax, it was reported that one of the Charlie Hebdo gunmen had trained with militants in Yemen. A link had also emerged between these two brothers and the police-killer behind the supermarket siege, in which several hostages are thought dead. Islamist terrorists may be rare, but nobody who cares for peace or freedom can doubt the duty on the state to disrupt such menacing networks.  &#10;&#10;Against this backdrop, the head of MI5 is bound to command attention, and on Thursday night Andrew Parker gave a speech about rising threats to British security. He pointed with justified pride to disrupted plots. He stressed, too, that there could be no guarantee that every attack would be averted. To have pretended otherwise would have been wrong. But Mr Parker is also, in his way, a political player, well aware that spelling out how a UK attack was “highly likely” will strengthen his hand in the ongoing push for powers. And he used the attention that he had grabbed in this way to make a disingenuous case for the sort of snooping whose exposure by Edward Snowden in 2013 caused outrage around the world.  &#10;&#10;The director-general whispered sweet reason. He emphasised the oversight the agency faces, and rejected, he said, the lazy insistence that more security had to mean less privacy. The tone was good; it was the substance that was wanting. He explained how decrypted emails of extremists had been used to foil one major airline plot, and how information was forensically recovered from a second bunch of fanatics, bent on blowing up London landmarks, after their arrest. Such pinpointed (and legally controlled) intelligence work might, perhaps, also have made a difference in Paris, where both the Charlie Hebdo murderers were on watchlists.  &#10;&#10;Mr Parker, however, lurched from detailing such targeted work to making oblique allusions to the entirely sweeping, and until 2013 entirely unacknowledged, probing of communication records, and the interference with internet traffic on the often-spurious pretext that it is “international” in a purely technical sense. These are the practices that give the state such chilling potential to keep exhaustive tabs on so many citizens. But the effect of Mr Parker’s intervention is to kick back against necessary reforms, and to pile on the pressure to put these controversial practices on to a permanent footing. As for the oversight he gave such weight to, its weakness was evident today when the chair of the intelligence and security committee, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, uncritically echoed virtually everything that he had said, blithely asserting that it wasn’t the intelligence agencies’ job to spy on ordinary people, as if the Snowden revelations had never happened.  &#10;&#10;Britain is still crying out for a debate that the security services continue to duck. The dreadful events of Paris do not change that position at all.  	Editorial: This week has not reset the basic arguments about security and privacy. Britain still needs the debate that the agencies would rather not have
109-haplessharmlesspalestinianle	aljazeera	Thu, 15 Jan 2015 10:34:22 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/01/hapless-harmless-palestinian-le-201511291024121636.html	Sharif Nashashibi	The hapless, harmless Palestinian leader?	January 15 marks a decade since Mahmoud Abbas became the Palestinian president, during which time the goals he claims to espouse not only remain unrealised, but are more remote than ever.  &#10;&#10;He is still in office despite his term ending six years ago; the democratic process that brought him to power no longer in existence. He speaks of his people's human rights while his Palestinian Authority actively curtails them. He claims to champion their national rights while collaborating unconditionally with the country that denies them.  &#10;&#10;Abbas' image as a hapless, harmless figure deflects from the cunning and ruthlessness of someone whose primary concern, like the Middle East's other autocrats, seems to be his longevity. The fact that he plays ball with the West and Israel somehow makes this okay. Where other Arab strongmen nurture an image of power to maintain it, he relies on being seen as an underdog.  &#10;&#10;But this illusion, which has traditionally served Abbas well, no longer extends to his people. Many think he and the PA serve their own interests and those of Israel, rather than those of the Palestinians. According to a poll last month, 55 percent believe that the PA has become "a burden on the Palestinian people".  &#10;&#10;Regarding the presidency, Abbas has consistently lagged in opinion polls behind his Fatah colleague, Marwan Barghouti. Since Israel's last Gaza invasion, he also runs behind Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. Is it mere coincidence, then, that Abbas has been lacklustre in campaigning for Barghouti's release from Israeli jail; or in pursuing and implementing national unity deals with Hamas that call for elections?  &#10;&#10;Since the signing of the latest reconciliation agreement in April, Abbas has at various times threatened to end it, and has been openly adversarial towards Hamas. Elections that were due within six months never happened, so he remains unchallenged - this has gone largely unnoticed.  &#10;&#10;The PA - which is meant to safeguard Palestinian rights - serially abuses them. Human Rights Watch has documented "police beatings and arbitrary arrests of demonstrators", "excessive force", "repressing critical news reporting and demonstrations", "suppressing dissenting views", and "serious rights abuses, including credible allegations of torture", for which "no security officials were convicted".  &#10;&#10;As such, the PA is not only failing to curb Israeli abuses, but is busy perpetrating its own, all under Abbas' watch.  &#10;&#10;The PA has garnered a reputation among Palestinians for managing the occupation rather than striving to end it. One way it does this is "security coordination" with Israel, which Abbas described last year as "sacred" despite the vast majority of Palestinians opposing it.  &#10;&#10;Such coordination serves Israel by enabling it to subcontract its occupation, and serves the PA by helping it suppress internal dissent. It certainly does not benefit the Palestinian people.  &#10;&#10;Abbas and his foreign minister have made grotesque assurances that as long as he is president, he will not allow an uprising against Israel. So the PA, which is supposed to be part of a national liberation struggle, is willing to put down an uprising by its own people against their subjugation. This is nothing short of betrayal.  &#10;&#10;For more than 20 years, the PA has participated in a "peace process" that has greatly entrenched Israeli control. Abbas himself was an architect of the disastrous Oslo Accords. The occupied territories are now so colonised and fragmented that a viable Palestinian state is widely considered impossible. Yet, Abbas still wants to negotiate, despite Israel being clearly opposed to Palestinian self-determination.  &#10;&#10;What, then, is the point of negotiating? Perhaps to preserve the privileged elites to which the PA and the "peace process" gave birth. After all, allegations of corruption and nepotism, including Abbas and his family, are nothing new. With the help of international aid, the PA is the largest employer of Palestinians, much like other autocracies that encourage public dependence on the state to avoid mass unrest.  &#10;&#10;A power imbalance alone cannot explain Abbas' policy choices regarding Israel. He opposes armed resistance, and has gone to great lengths to disarm militants in the West Bank.  &#10;&#10;However, he also opposes peaceful forms of resistance, including the increasingly effective Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.  &#10;&#10;Furthermore, it took the PA more than two years since Palestine's upgraded UN status to apply to join the International Criminal Court, despite repeated threats to do so amid constant Israeli provocations.  &#10;&#10;That Abbas finally relented may not only, or necessarily, be about losing patience with Israel, but about assuaging mounting Palestinian anger at his procrastination in applying to the ICC.  &#10;&#10;Meanwhile, he says he will keep pushing for a UN Security Council resolution calling for a deadline to end Israel's occupation, despite the certainty of repeated failure by US veto.  &#10;&#10;Abbas seems to be attempting a balancing act. He wants to prove to Israel, and his western and Arab backers, that he is their best Palestinian partner, safe in the knowledge that they will not accept Hamas rule, but mindful not to suffer the same fate as Yasser Arafat once he was no longer deemed useful or reliable.  &#10;&#10;However, his recent, uncharacteristic defiance against Israel reflects a need to stop his flagging domestic popularity turning into an uprising against him and the PA.  &#10;&#10;Abbas has nothing to show his people after 10 years as president, and at least another decade as part of the "peace process". He remains in office because of, not despite, Israel's occupation and Palestinian disunity.  	Where other Arab strongmen nurture an image of power, Abbas relies on being&#10;seen as an underdog.&#10;&#10;

The young vote least and they get least, so the old voters are showered with blessings by the Cameron government. New research from the House of Commons library shows women are voting less and less: 9.1 million women failed to vote last time and at each election the gap between women and men voters has grown wider. In 2010, 1.1 million fewer women than men voted – so is it any surprise Cameron and Osborne let them pay the heaviest price in the great austerity?  &#10;&#10;Polls show women are more likely to vote Labour than men, for good reason. Just about all progress for women has come from Labour governments – from abortion and divorce law reform, to equal rights and equal pay laws. The Blair-Brown years brought free nursery schools for three- and four-year-olds, 3,500 Sure Start children’s centres, better-paid longer maternity leave, child tax credits, childcare credits, flexible working and a lot more. Labour’s all- woman shortlists produced many more female MPs than the other parties: Miliband promises a 50% female cabinet.  &#10;&#10;Over the past five years, Harriet Harman, Gloria de Piero, Fiona Mactaggart and others have been leading women’s meetings all round the country – largely unnoticed by the press, listening to the growing pressure on mothers and grandmothers. As childcare costs shoot out of reach, more grandmothers have cut their working hours to help daughters take jobs, yet their retirement age is rising to 67 and they still need to work. Many still have aged parents needing care at the same time. Mactaggart is shortly producing a manifesto from her Commission on Older Women.  &#10;&#10;The government boasts that two-thirds of those who have gained most from raising the personal tax threshold are women. But they don’t explain why: women are still clustered in the lowest paying jobs. Nor do they admit that low-paid women have lost far more through benefit cuts than they have gained in tax cuts.  &#10;&#10;As the parties slug it out for the women’s vote, Tories and Liberal Democrats will struggle to convince. Harman is constructing an entire women’s campaign, wrapped within Labour’s platform, not as an afterthought but based on the historic difference in how the parties treat female citizens. “Women hold the balance of power,” Harman says – and she’s right: the result may depend on Labour’s success in rousing up the missing millions of female voters.

111-hinchingbrookeprivatisationnhs	guardian	2015-01-09T12:48:15Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/09/hinchingbrooke-privatisation-nhs-hospital-private-contractor-circle	Tom Clark	The Hinchingbrooke fiasco shows privatisation is no answer to NHS woes	The great delusion of Andrew Lansley was to imagine that by bringing the market into the NHS, he could take the politics out. News this morning that Circle – the first private company to run an entire health service hospital – is manoeuvring to pull itself out will demonstrate precisely the opposite. The ramifications of privatisation could leave the service more electorally charged than ever before.  &#10;&#10;Parliament eventually imposed a deeply confused rewrite on the former health secretary’s bill, but his original masterplan – which David Cameron and Nick Clegg initially endorsed without bothering to read – was arrestingly clear. There would be a new healthcare market where funds followed the patients. NHS clinics and hospitals that couldn’t win enough customers would go to the wall, while new commercial entrants storm in. Holding the ring would be a remote regulator similar to that which oversees the electricity sector – with an overriding duty to “promote competition”. The thinking was that all those painful decisions that the experts always say are needed, but which the politicians have always ducked, would finally be settled as the unarguable consequence of choices made by patients themselves.  &#10;&#10;While it is true that the particular process that led to Circle assuming control of Hinchingbrooke hospital predates the Lansley reforms, tracing back to earlier New Labour flirtations with privatisation, its story nonetheless illustrates neatly why the Lansley plan was never going to work. Hinchingbrooke is in Huntingdon, where – as across much of the south of England – the local area supports more hospitals than a health service planner who was starting from scratch would go for. Every academic and thinktank report in health says that the way to make the NHS more efficient is “to move care closer to patients in their communities”, and away from general infirmaries. But the move is rarely made decisively, because no politician wants to shut things down. The pre-privatisation Hinchingbrooke quietly sank into being a basket case. Private enterprise spotted a chance to prove its worth, and – with some fanfare – rode in to “turn it round”.  &#10;&#10;Glowing headlines about both improving patient experience and even improving finances would soon follow. But today one surely has to ask how much of that was just sharp PR. After all, the tricky underlying economics of healthcare in the region were not transformed – as the financial woes of nearby Peterborough and Stamford NHS foundation trust illustrate. And now, out of the blue – in a manner reminiscent of G4S’s eve-of-Olympics confession that it was not going to do the full security that it had signed up for – the private contractor at Hinchingbrooke has admitted that it is losing its appetite for the job.  &#10;&#10;The same spin that previously flattered the company is now directed without mercy against the politicians instead. The company’s statement highlights not only the developing A&E; crisis, but also the “inconsistent and conflicting regulatory regime” in the post-Lansley landscape, as well the gulf between NHS and social care services that Labour’s Andy Burnham has made a particular line of attack on the coalition. These are real problems, but all could have been seen coming when Circle first got involved.  &#10;&#10;If this were a more conventional marketplace, it would be hard to grasp why serious investors would suddenly be pulling out. But then again, if healthcare were a more conventional market, serious investors would probably not have piled in, particularly in a region with one hospital too many in the first place. As with rail franchises, the emerging NHS market is attractive to private industry precisely because politicians stand behind it with a public chequebook. Much more detail is still to emerge, but my best guess is that Circle is moving to terminate its contract now because it imagined it would be able to swing more favourable treatment than it got.  &#10;&#10;From outsourced IT systems to over-priced PFIs, the British taxpayer has over a generation been learning the hard way that it is not wise to sign contracts that are hard to specify. When unexpected contingencies crop up private “partners” have got you over a barrel; when you fail to bend to their wishes, they can simply walk away. Today we are, perhaps, seeing exactly the same sort of problems affecting the NHS.  &#10;&#10;The big questions in healthcare remain unanswered, and the political blame game remains just as intense as before. Indeed, it is even spiced up by the enterprising resources of private spin. And what solution has Monitor – Lansley’s regulator – floated for Hinchingbrooke’s struggling NHS neighbour at Peterborough and Stamford? Why, bringing in the private sector, of course.  	Tom Clark: First thoughts: The hospital is beset with problems and the contractor – Circle – wants to just walk away. All this could have been predicted

Did the milk and cookies violate the school’s “Let’s Move” food rules?  &#10;&#10;It’s hard to know for sure -- but I’m going to take a wild guess and say they probably thought Santa was the “Reason for the Season.”  &#10;&#10;CLICK HERE TO FOLLOW TODD ON FACEBOOK FOR CONSERVATIVE CONVERSATION.  &#10;&#10;Moms and dads around Cambridge, Mass. say the principal’s ban is naughty, not nice and some are ready to jingle somebody’s bells.  &#10;&#10;“I come from a city that celebrates diversity and tolerance,” parent Robert Thompson told Fox & Friends. “At its base this decision reeks of intolerance.”  &#10;&#10;Instead, Jolly Old Saint Nick has been relegated to a family sing-along on the day before Christmas Eve. Thompson said as if they are saying Santa is not “good enough for the main show.”  &#10;&#10;The school was afraid even that even the presence of Old St. Nick overly sensitive residents.  &#10;&#10;“I am sensitive to the fact that you may not want your child involved in this event,” Ford wrote in a letter obtained by the Boston Globe. “If you prefer that your child spend time with me that afternoon, please let me know. I will be in the library, playing games and reading books with the children.”  &#10;&#10;How’s that for an unadulterated does of liberal lunacy? It’s enough to curdle your egg nog.  &#10;&#10;Jeffrey Young is the superintendent of this calamitous mess of public education. He told the Globe he doesn’t understand why Santa needs to visit the Peabody School.  &#10;&#10;“There’s no anti-Santa sentiment,” he told the newspaper. “It’s just that there’s no pro-Santa sentiment either … Santa’s not on the top of my list”  &#10;&#10;I’d be willing to bet a pound of fruitcake the superintendent is at the top of Santa’s list.  &#10;&#10;Mr. Thompson said the school celebrates all sorts of cultures – so why not his?  &#10;&#10;“They are telling me mine is not acceptable,” he said.  &#10;&#10;Of course, this is the hometown of Harvard University – so it’s fair to say they have a disproportionate number of certifiable citizens.  &#10;&#10;This is the same town that in 2007 stopped a Boy Scout troop from collecting care packages for American soldiers. They scouts were accused of making a political statement.  &#10;&#10;And how can we forget about the city’s war on carbonation? The mayor wanted to ban any bottled soft drinks larger than 16 ounces. They also wanted to decide how much popcorn citizens could pop and how many milkshakes citizens could slurp.  &#10;&#10;And if you need further proof that Cambridge is to the left of Vladimir Putin, consider this item from the 2006 edition of The Harvard Crimson. A member of the Cambridge Public Schools Committee compared a law mandating the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance to a “post 9/11 ultra-patriotism push.”  &#10;&#10;School committee member Luc Schuster told the newspaper that “pledging blind allegiance” to the United States stifles the intellectual capacity of children.”  &#10;&#10;You just can’t argue with that kind of ignorance, folks. Sounds to me like they’ve been smoking too much mistletoe.  &#10;&#10;As they say back home in Tennessee – the cheese has done slid off the cracker.  &#10;&#10;Ho, ho, ho, America!  	A Cambridge, Massachusetts school that advertises itself as an “inclusive&#10;community” banned Santa Claus from its annual Christmas concert after someone&#10;complained.&#10;&#10;

Without spoiling the plot I can reveal that it has a happy ending.  &#10;&#10;So Hollywood loves Obama and, not surprisingly, Obama loves it right back. In fact, he is an admirer of its role in the world.  &#10;&#10;“Believe it or not, entertainment is part of our American diplomacy,” Obama told an A-list gathering of movie stars and film executives at DreamWorks, in November 2013. "It is part of what makes us exceptional, part of what makes us such a world power. Hundreds of millions of people may never set foot in the United States, but thanks to you, they\'ve experienced a small part of what makes our country special. They\'ve learned something about our values. We have shaped a world culture through you…in a way that has made the world better.”  &#10;&#10;This is what is known as a matter of opinion. A dissenting view is held by hundreds of millions of Muslims who consider the incursions of the American cinema to be a dangerous and despicable form of Zionist-Crusader cultural imperialism.  &#10;&#10;Obama’s speech to Hollywood will not disabuse them of this belief. “[Foreigners] might not know the Gettysburg Address,” Obama said, “but if they’re watching some old movie, maybe "Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner," or “The Mary Tyler Moore Show,” or “Will and Grace” and “Modern Family,” they\'ve had a front-row seat to our march towards progress, even if their own nations haven’t made that progress yet. And young people in countries all around the world suddenly make a connection and have an affinity to people who look don’t like them and maybe originally they might have been fearful of, and now suddenly they say, oh, this person is like me -- which is one of the powers of art, but that’s what you transmit.”  &#10;&#10;It would be comforting to think that the president was simply flattering his audience. If he actually believes this, his lack of sophistication about the Middle East makes George W. Bush look like Lawrence of Arabia.  &#10;&#10;"Mary Tyler Moore"? Women aren\'t even allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia. They are forced to wear “modest” clothing down to their ankles in Iran.  &#10;&#10;In most of the region, a woman who disobeys her husband or talks back to him faces a beating at best, usually with the hearty approval of the wife’s family father and brothers.  &#10;&#10;"Will and Grace"? Homosexuality is a capital crime throughout most of the Arab world because it is seen as an offense against Allah and the family.  &#10;&#10;The only gay bars in the Arab world and Iran are on the windows of prison cells.  &#10;&#10;"Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner"? A Muslim girl crazy enough to bring home an infidel fiancé is inviting a sequel: "Guess Who’s Having a Funeral"?  &#10;&#10;Parents, clergy and community elders in the Middle East are not entertained, let alone edified, by Hollywood values. They are horrified by what they see as a godless foreign assault on their children, their religion and their way of life. In most places even G-rated films are considered transgressive.  &#10;&#10;They can be found mostly via under-the-counter bootleggers or downloaded in secret.  &#10;&#10;And they are.  &#10;&#10;Their impact on young people is not the liberation Obama imagines, however. Unmarried men do not have unfettered access to members of the opposite sex and many find explicit depictions to be frustrating and humiliating. In some, they even inspire a militant puritanical Islam that makes posthumous sex the ultimate reward for killing infidels. Unmarried young women, lacking even that outlet, need to be careful and obedient to the code of conduct.  &#10;&#10;A girl caught trying to emulate the tamest teenage movie role model puts her life in danger.  &#10;&#10;My point is not that Hollywood is wrong to make movies and television shows that reflect American social values and suit the American audience. And I certainly don’t expect the president to inform his biggest boosters that their creations ignite resentment, hostility and holy war.  &#10;&#10;I do hope, though, that the president and his advisers understand this: "Will and Grace," "Mary Tyler Moore" and even the new Obama biopic may win Oscars and Emmys, but in a struggle for hearts and minds in a region where cutting- edge refers to swords, not cinema, Hollywood is not a strategic American asset.  	Hollywood loves Barack Obama and it has expressed this this in every way it&#10;knows how, from celebrity endorsements and campaign appearances to huge&#10;donations. In the 2012 presidential race, show biz folks gave Obama more than&#10;six million dollars, five times as much as Romney got. It has even been&#10;announced that a biopic of Obama’s first date with Michelle—dinner and a Spike&#10;Lee movie--is on the way. Without spoiling the plot I can reveal that the it&#10;has a happy ending.&#10;&#10;
114-hostagerescuedilemmalukeso	aljazeera	Sun, 07 Dec 2014 02:11:02 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/hostage-rescue-dilemma-luke-so-2014127125227887573.html	Martin Reardon	 The hostage rescue dilemma	Saturday's failed hostage rescue mission in Yemen was indeed tragic. While the official details as to exactly what happened have not yet been released, it appears Luke Somers, an American journalist, and Pierre Korkie, a South African teacher, were killed by their captors during a night-time rescue attempt carried out by US Navy SEALs.  &#10;&#10;Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) had been holding Somers and Korkie captive for over a year. It was the second such attempt to rescue Somers in two weeks. On November 25, a SEALs team hit what they thought was the compound holding Somers, who, as it turns out, had been moved from there just hours before.  &#10;&#10;In Saturday's operation, the SEALs knew Somers' exact location. To maintain stealth, they landed by V-22 Osprey several kilometres away, and then made the trek overland to the compound where Somers and Korkie were being held captive. But something went terribly wrong in the final approach. Perhaps it was a barking dog or some other noise, but the SEALs came under fire as they approached the compound's main entrance. The element of surprise, which is so critical to rescue operations, was lost, and a fierce firefight ensued. Within 30 minutes, the SEALs had secured the compound and put Somers and Korkie, who were both still alive on a V-22 that had a surgical team standing by. Unfortunately, medics were unable to save them.  &#10;&#10;Plainly necessary  &#10;&#10;For Somers, Saturday's rescue mission was as urgent as it was plainly necessary. Late last week AQAP released a video stating he would be killed in 72 hours unless unspecified demands were met. Those demands have not been made public, but likely involved payment of a ransom or release of AQAP captives, something the US is prohibited by law from doing.  &#10;&#10;For Korkie, the sense of urgency in attempting the rescue operation is more controversial. According to the South African charity Gift of the Giving, a deal had been made with AQAP to release Korkie in just a matter of days, suggesting to many that it would have been better to wait.  &#10;&#10;Maybe there was a deal that would have gone through in the end. Maybe there wasn't. But in rescue operations, hope is not figured into the equation, where planners and decision makers have to weigh the risks of action against the consequences of inaction.  &#10;&#10;By their very nature, hostage rescue operations are among the most difficult and risky military missions to carry out. With little margin for error, either in intelligence or the operation itself, they demand highly trained and equipped special operations units that only a handful of countries have. Are they dangerous and uncertain? Absolutely. Are they impossible? No.  &#10;&#10;In 2012, US Navy SEALs rescued Jessica Buchanan, an American aid worker, and Poul Hagen Thisted, a Danish aid worker, who had been held hostage by Somali pirates for 93 days. The pirates were demanding a $45m ransom for their release. In this particular case, precise intelligence as to their exact location, along with concerns about Buchanan's rapidly declining health, were major factors in moving forward with the rescue mission. Under the cover of darkness, the SEAL Team parachuted 19km from where they were being held, and then moved cross-country to conduct the rescue. Nine pirates were killed during the operation, and Buchanan and Thisted were unharmed.  &#10;&#10;In 2009, US Navy SEAL snipers ended the hostage ordeal of American Richard Phillips, captain of the cargo ship Maersk Alabama, which had been hijacked by Somali pirates in the Indian Ocean five days earlier. Talks with the pirates ended when they threw the phone used to communicate with negotiators into the ocean. When one of the pirates pointed his rifle at Captain Phillips' back, snipers shot and killed all three in near simultaneous fashion. Captain Phillips was unharmed.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;Heartbreaking failures  &#10;&#10;In 2005, US Delta Force operators rescued Roy Hallums, an American civilian contractor kidnapped by an al-Qaeda cell in Iraq, after 311 days in captivity. Again, the intelligence as to Hallums' location was exact - pull up the kitchen carpet and open the faux cement trap door leading into his one room cell. Hallums was unharmed in the operation.  &#10;&#10;But, as was all too evident on Saturday, there are heartbreaking failures, too. This past July, US special operations forces attempted to rescue James Foley in Syria. Unfortunately, the intelligence as to where he was being held was incorrect. Foley was brutally murdered by ISIL just a few weeks later, the videotape of which was released on the internet for the world to see.  &#10;&#10;In 2010, the US special operations team attempting to rescue her in Afghanistan accidentally killed Linda Norgrove, a British citizen. There are other failures, all tragic, as well.  &#10;&#10;But there are also other successes, where hostages like Jessica Buchanan, Poul Thisted, Captain Phillips and Roy Hallums, all of whom faced indefinite captivity or even death, are home with their families because decisions were made to rescue them based on calculated risks. No guessing, no maybes, no "let's keep our fingers crossed and hope for the best".  &#10;&#10;Rescue missions are risky, both for the hostages and for the operators who carry them out. Lives are at stake, and it's never an easy choice to give the "green light". But given the circumstances, particularly when dealing with terrorist organisations, leaders can't always sit back and wait to see what happens.  &#10;&#10;Sometimes, it's less risky to act than not to. And in the case of a hostage rescue operation, I'd place my life in the hands of men dedicated to the task before taking my chances with the likes of a terrorist in the hope that maybe they'll let me go.  	Sometimes it's less risky to act than not to.&#10;&#10;

When customers and employees were taken hostage by a lone gunman, and a flag with "There is only one God” inscription in Arabic was held in the window, it was enough to hold the rest of the country hostage to their fears and TV screens. Should it be that way and what should an appropriate response look like?  &#10;&#10;First, consider what this violent thug had designed our reaction to be. The site of the siege was likely no afterthought - located in the heart of the Sydney CBD and directly opposite a major television station, the shop had made it ideal for the media to report on. Streets were cordoned off, public transport diverted, and a strong contingent of police sent to the Opera House. All made for good visuals of the incident and terror in an otherwise peaceful city.  &#10;&#10;Even the most left-leaning and progressive members of parliament, like Greens MP Adam Bandt, who have repeatedly defended the Muslim community from unjust discrimination and generalisation, tweeted to their followers in the first hours of the siege that it was "terrifying". Was it really? Was it at all terrifying for you personally, Adam? If it was, I'd hate to know what the hostages experienced, including the two who were murdered.  &#10;&#10;A strike in the public's dark  &#10;&#10;For once, Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a more mature response than his colleagues on the opposite side. Such a situation can "scare people out of being themselves", he said in his first press briefing, before urging all Australians to go about their business as usual. Although he told the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the authorities, he said so with calm and caution. Vitally, he avoided using the t-word at this early stage, or any formulation thereof.  &#10;&#10;No doubt we have since learnt a lot more about this deranged outsider and his motives, and it is clear he had terrorist intent. His website, which was shut down during the final hours of the siege, had a message dated December 14, which described why Muslims "fight against the oppression and terrorism" of the US and its allies, including the UK and Australia.  &#10;&#10;The rampant speculation before this was unnecessary and unhelpful, however, and letting the siege sow fear, enough so to publicly describe it as "terrifying", was handing a victory to an extremist.  &#10;&#10;With the hot Australian summer setting in, many people's minds turn to beer, barbeques, family, and Christmas presents, not the possibility of "politically motivated violence", as Abbott wisely phrased it.  &#10;&#10;Intriguingly, Australians fear terrorism more than a foreign invasion, despite many believing we'd have no hope of fending off the latter and despite us never directly experiencing the former. Given the opportunity to attribute a complexly motivated act to terrorism, it's no wonder this all-too-easy escape mechanism which avoids rigorous thought or objective analysis was adopted en masse.  &#10;&#10;The most noted incidents in Australia's experience of terrorism have been mostly foreign tragedies, like the Bali bombings in 2002 and 2005, or the 2004 Australian embassy bombing in Jakarta. Although the September raids and arrests of suspected domestic terrorists in Sydney and Brisbane set a new landscape and brought the thought of an attack to our own shores, they merely raised the thought, not the authentic actuality.  &#10;&#10;The raids sparked limited local backlash against peaceful Muslims at the time, and this was both unwarranted and unwanted. Though it only goes to further support my thesis; Australians just aren't used to this sort of thing and thus are unpractised in their response.  &#10;&#10;That said, it hasn't stopped thousands on social media to show solidarity with minorities through the #IllRideWithYou campaign.  &#10;&#10;When the Abbott government raised the domestic terrorism threat level to high before the September raids, many local commentators criticised what they branded as political theatre (both before and after the arrests).  &#10;&#10;To consider this is to suggest an even baser type of political animal than is presently expected by even the most cynical of observers. Would any rational actor toy with people's lives for short-term political ends in what was an unimportant political week? What end does that even achieve? Plainly, none, and it is sensationally conspiratorialist to suggest otherwise.  &#10;&#10;To protest against such raids and continue looking at them through a political lens was just as unwarranted and unwanted as the racial-profiling and racial- hatred which events like these have sparked.  &#10;&#10;Terrorism isn't something that we should let foster, anywhere, and the public reactions to the raids were unjustifiably sceptical in comparison to the response to the Sydney siege.  &#10;&#10;Even so, the authorities' heed for caution may have come too late for some. Slipshod media reports that the flag held in the shop window was an ISIL flag - when it was not - may have already fuelled the imaginations of too many.  &#10;&#10;Whatever the outcome of the full investigation, one thing remains clear: This was a tragic learning experience for the Australian media, public, and politicians. Keep calm and carry on, though pay a thought or two to how we ought to respond to events like these in the future.  	It was clear that the hostage-taker wanted media attention and Australian&#10;media gave him what he wanted.&#10;&#10;
116-ifabbottisseriousabouttackling	guardian	2015-01-06T00:14:17Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/06/if-abbott-is-serious-about-tackling-terrorism-cutting-foreign-aid-is-the-worst-way-to-go-about-it	Katie Morris	If Abbott is serious about tackling terrorism, cutting foreign aid is the worst way to go about it	In conjunction with the joint military action against Islamic State (Isis), Tony Abbott has pledged $5m in humanitarian aid for Iraq on his recent surprise visit to Baghdad. But don’t be fooled by the government’s apparent show of generosity – Australia isn’t giving any more to foreign aid than it was before. In fact, it is giving significantly less.  &#10;&#10;It is vitally important that we don’t stop talking about recent cuts to foreign aid. The government’s mid-year economic and fiscal outlook has reduced the foreign aid budget to the lowest levels in Australian history. Foreign aid spending has been cut by almost $3.7bn over four years. In addition to the $7.6bn already cut in May’s federal budget, foreign aid has been cut by one quarter.  &#10;&#10;If the government is serious about tackling terrorist threats and defending “universal values”, cutting off foreign aid to programmes that provide education, reduce poverty and improve gender equality is one of the worst ways to go about it.  &#10;&#10;The Save Australian Aid campaign states that $11bn in foreign aid – the amount cut from the foreign aid budget in the past year – is the equivalent of 2 million children who may not be able to enrol in school, 1.4 million births without a birth attendant, 3.7 million children who may not receive vaccinations, 4.7 million people who will have reduced access to safe water, and almost 22 million people with reduced assistance in emergency situations.  &#10;&#10;These cuts further perpetuate the idea that Australia is not a team player, a notion fuelled by our past behaviour towards our neighbours, and our recent denials of international obligations towards asylum seekers and climate change.  &#10;&#10;In addition to the cuts in the Myefo, Australia backed out of commitments made to tax justice in the recent G20 summit. It is estimated that developing nations lose $160bn per year to corporate tax dodging; an amount that would end world hunger three times over.  &#10;&#10;The G20 commitment, Abbott said, was “about the countries of the world, the people of the world, receiving the tax benefits that are their due and it’s needed so that governments can fund the infrastructure and the services that people expect and deserve.” As the host of the G20, backing out of this commitment not only damages our international credibility, but also has a huge impact on the developing world.  &#10;&#10;The foreign aid cuts are irresponsible, but not surprising. Cutting the aid budget sends a clear message to our developing neighbours that Australia won’t lend a helping hand unless it’s in our own best interest.  &#10;&#10;However, our politicians seem to forget that there is something in it for us, and not only in Iraq. Aid is much more than a humanitarian gesture; it’s a tool for regional development, trust and cooperation. Foreign aid programmes promote stability through education and equality, in turn reducing conflict. As an added bonus, foreign aid and sustainable development programmes create stronger economies, which in turn create opportunities at home and abroad.  &#10;&#10;Poverty breeds hopelessness and despair, which are both contributing factors to extremist behaviour. Foreign aid is not the only factor in answering this issue, but it’s more than a step in the right direction.  &#10;&#10;Higher levels of foreign aid have the potential not to only alleviate extreme poverty in our region, but to raise international opinion of Australia as a fair country. A recent study examining the effects of foreign aid on foreign public opinion found that US aid programmes targeting HIV/Aids have improved perceptions of the US among the public in recipient countries.  &#10;&#10;Australia would reap these benefits as a side effect of foreign aid, saving the millions of dollars set aside to “stop the boats” and wage a “war on terror”. But our government has, predictably, made yet another irresponsible decision with untold repercussions. While two innocent people died in Martin Place on 16 December in what has been labelled an act of terror, a reduction of this size in the foreign aid budget will result in the unnecessary deaths of hundreds across the globe due to reduced access to vital services.  &#10;&#10;The high priority the Abbott government has placed on security doesn’t come cheap, with funds for anti-terrorism programmes costing billions of dollars. Wouldn’t this money be better spent reducing inequality, poverty, and conflict? Shouldn’t we be stopping the problem at the source, not trying to cure the symptoms?  	Abbott’s pledge for $5m in humanitarian aid to Iraq should shine a light on why foreign aid is an integral part of combating terrorism

Greece is heading towards snap elections on January 25 after the conservative coalition government, currently in office, failed to reach a supermajority of 180 MPs in order to elect the new president of the republic as dictated by the Greek constitution.  &#10;&#10;Stavros Demas, a former European Commissioner and candidate of choice of the two ruling parties, was never really proposed with the purpose to achieve and express the maximum consensus among the Greek population. Demas is coming from the heart of the ruling conservative New Democracy party and symbolises the party's loyalty to the current establishment in the EU.  &#10;&#10;The main opposition party, SYRIZA, openly invested in the constitutional opportunity to overturn the government months ago claiming that its endurance in office for two more years would be abnormal as it would contradict the popular sentiment tracked in every opinion poll during the past year or so.  &#10;&#10;By all odds, SYRIZA is leading the polls by 3 percent to 10 percent and is expected to form a government either based on a robust majority of the left in parliament, or, in coalition with minor parties who are willing to follow its agenda, renegotiate a bailout agreement that will not be catastrophic for Greek society and the Greek economy.  &#10;&#10;Despite the fact that both the German and the Greek conservative governments present the current bailout programme as a "success story", most analysts around the globe agree that it has actually failed. Six years of continuing recession have resulted in a loss of 25 percent of GDP and a rise of unemployment to 27 percent.  &#10;&#10;Greek debt is well over 170 percent of GDP now and according to Troika estimations it will be no less than 120 percent by 2020.  &#10;&#10;These facts translate to two things. Firstly, there can be no development under austerity policies for the majority of the population, even if the Eurozone fixes its competitiveness problem and exits deflation and the Greek economy starts developing at a growth rate of over 4 percent - which is highly unlikely.  &#10;&#10;Secondly, there can be no functioning democracy so long as Greece is not given choices other than poverty, degrowth and exclusion. Greece is in the state of protectorate at the moment, bound in a bailout agreement that strips its ability to produce and reject different solutions.  &#10;&#10;But it's not just Greece.  &#10;&#10;Spain follows the same path both in regards to the social crisis and the political management of that crisis. Poverty and unemployment figures look much like the Greek ones and the Spanish conservative government resorts to authoritarian measures in order to keep the Spanish society tight. For example, the public security law voted a few days ago is a clear attempt of the government to muzzle protests over its handling of the financial crisis.  &#10;&#10;Deflation hits Europe and the prospects of its biggest economies like France's, Italy's and Germany's, are not looking good to pull the Eurozone back to the track of growth. As a result, political forces that question austerity are gaining momentum whether they are nationalist Euroskeptic and even fascist, or progressive, democratic and pro-European like the Spanish ally party of SYRIZA, Podemos.  &#10;&#10;What is striking about SYRIZA is that its critique and analysis since 2009 have been proven to be correct despite the continuing fear campaign against him both inside and out of the country.  &#10;&#10;Recently Prime Minister Antonis Samaras accused the party of the radical left that it will lead Greece to default and bankruptcy if it tries to negotiate lighter terms for the repayment of the Greek debt.  &#10;&#10;Jean Claude Juncker's Commission has been issuing exhortations to the Greek electorate not to vote for SYRIZA and German finance minister is openly saying that there is no alternative for Greece, no matter which government comes in office.  &#10;&#10;But economic analysts who have defended the reforms are starting to agree with SYRIZA on several issues, including the need to stop austerity and move faster to a process of debt forgiveness. FT's Wolfgang Munchau writes that "the radical left is right about Europe's debt". Bloomberg argues that the end of austerity may boost the global economy and even Morgan Stanley asks bond holders not to be afraid of the coming elections.  &#10;&#10;Despite the fear-mongering campaign, economic analysts reject now a possible "grexit" due to markets' belief that some kind of deal is preferable both for Greece and the EU.  &#10;&#10;In this environment, a SYRIZA victory would mean two very important things; the return of the power to decide to a democratically elected government and the restoration of inclusiveness and national sovereignty and the opening of a new chapter in European politics, where the parties and the organisations who challenge austerity will have the momentum.  &#10;&#10;The Greek people have patiently given the opportunity to the neoliberal technocrats of the IMF and the EU along with their local counterparts in the conservative coalition government to experiment and find a way out of the mess for more than five years only to receive back pain and failure.  &#10;&#10;Now they're being given the opportunity to exercise their democratic right to choose which way the country will turn. SYRIZA is asking for debt forgiveness and a New Deal for Europe, both rather moderate demands coming from a radical left party.  &#10;&#10;If SYRIZA actually wins the elections, the Greek people will be the first to send a clear message against austerity, one that can spark change, much needed on the continent right now. And if SYRIZA succeeds then Europe may start a new page in its economic and political history.  	A SYRIZA victory would mean a clear message by the Greek people against&#10;austerity.&#10;&#10;

Our nation’s immigration laws can be difficult to understand. Our Constitution, however, isn’t complicated. Our system of government is simple.  &#10;&#10;Congress writes the law, the president executes the law, and the judiciary interprets the law. The president does not make new law.  &#10;&#10;That concept is called the “separation of powers,” and it’s of core importance to our democracy. As a bulwark against tyranny, our Founders determined that no single branch of government could perform all the functions of government—making, enforcing, and interpreting the law. In other words, our Founders took the classic powers of a king and divided them between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches.  &#10;&#10;For our government to work, those functions must remain separate.  &#10;&#10;But President Obama disagrees with the Founders. In his view, apparently, government is only truly “working” when he gets the policies he wants. When he doesn’t, he calls that “obstructionism” and gets busy finding workarounds to democracy.  &#10;&#10;While presidents do have a degree of discretion in determining exactly how to enforce the law, President Obama’s immigration actions go far, far beyond that lawful discretion and veer directly into lawmaking, the exclusive role of the legislature.  &#10;&#10;Here’s how:  &#10;&#10;President Obama is taking action in direct defiance to Congress’s “expressed or implied intent,” and that means his power—constitutionally—is at its “lowest ebb.”  &#10;&#10;Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, in the seminal case of Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, outlined an influential three-part test for executive action. Presidential power is “at its maximum” when acting pursuant to congressional authorization. There is a “zone of twilight” when the distribution of power between Congress and the president is uncertain. Then, there’s the “lowest ebb,” when the president defies Congress.  &#10;&#10;That’s exactly what President Obama did.  &#10;&#10;Article I of the Constitution grants Congress -- not the president -- the power to “establish a uniform Rule of Naturalizations,” and Congress has acted under that power to write and pass a comprehensive set of immigration statutes. Many people disagree with those laws—and President Obama is particularly dissatisfied—but they are still the law.  &#10;&#10;And the president certainly can’t hide behind “prosecutorial discretion.” The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) —the government lawyers President Obama asked to evaluate his proposed program—were clear, declaring that the president cannot “under the guise of exercising enforcement discretion, attempt to effectively rewrite the laws to match its policy preference.”  &#10;&#10;Thus, as the Secretary of Homeland Security said, “As an act of prosecutorial discretion, deferred action is legally available so long as it is granted on a case-by-case basis, and it may be terminated at any time at the agency’s discretion.”  &#10;&#10;But did President Obama promise a “case-by-case” determination, or did he make a sweeping promise to millions of illegal immigrants? He didn’t promise them a careful review, he promised them a deal. Here are his words:  &#10;&#10;So we’re going to offer the following deal: If you’ve with been in America more than five years. If you have children who are American citizens or illegal residents. If you register, pass a criminal background check and you’re willing to pay your fair share of taxes, you’ll be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily without fear of deportation. You can come out of the shadows and get right with the law. That’s what this deal is.  &#10;&#10;Tuesday, I am testifying before the House Judiciary Committee. I am examining the “deal” President Obama offers and compare it with the requirements of the law -- the requirement of a case-by-case review. The “deal” does not match the law.  &#10;&#10;Put simply, if President Obama is enacting the “case-by-case” review mandated by the OLC memo, he is misleading the four million illegal aliens he encouraged to come “out of the shadows.” If he is defying the attorneys at the OLC and giving illegal aliens the “deal” he promised, then he is misleading the American public.  &#10;&#10;No one disputes that our nation faces an immigration challenge. We’ve got a porous, dangerous border, a flood of illegal immigrants whose increasing numbers drive down wages and can overburden social services, and we’ve got millions of people in the country who are looking for some form of permanent status. No one doubts that legislative reform is necessary.  &#10;&#10;I believe we need comprehensive immigration reform beginning with securing our borders. We truly are a nation of immigrants. I am the grandson of a Russian immigrant. But that reform must be done lawfully and in accordance with the Constitution.  &#10;&#10;The bottom line: impatient presidents may not violate the Constitution if they don’t get their way.  &#10;&#10;In doing so—in circumventing Congress to change the law—President Obama has set a dangerous precedent.  &#10;&#10;Congress must reassert its authority and preserve our Constitution. Our democracy is at stake.  	While presidents do have a degree of discretion in determining exactly how to&#10;enforce the law, President Obama’s immigration actions go far, far beyond that&#10;lawful discretion and veer directly into lawmaking, the exclusive role of the&#10;legislature.&#10;&#10;

As in America, this has put pressure on British taxpayers, many of whom think these migrants are taking jobs from British citizens and overburdening schools and the National Health Service.  &#10;&#10;In a recent speech, Cameron proposed denying EU migrants access to certain welfare and other benefits for four years, including denial of a child allowance, unless the immigrant children live with their parents in Britain. "Thus eliminating," writes the Wall Street Journal, "an incentive for immigrant families that try to arbitrage Britain\'s generous welfare state by raising children back home where costs are lower." One parent lives in Britain to get the benefit, another stays in their home country with the children, who live on Britain\'s pound. No child benefit or tax credits paid for children living outside the UK, Cameron proposes. And he\'s right. He hopes such a move, if approved by Parliament, might deter thousands more unemployed immigrants from coming to Britain. Cameron still must win approval from the other EU member nations and that is unlikely.  &#10;&#10;Poland has warned that it will vote against the proposal unless it also applies to British citizens who are unemployed and seeking benefits. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was reported to be "hopping mad" over Cameron\'s proposal, so it remains doubtful if Cameron will get more than a short-term bump in his approval numbers ahead of next spring\'s anticipated elections.  &#10;&#10;Some conservatives within Cameron\'s Tory Party want Britain out of the EU, a position that goes back to the days of the late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who was skeptical of the EU from the start and feared the loss of British sovereignty and identity.  &#10;&#10;The Washington Post recently reported "Net migration into (Britain) is now nearly at a post-recession high -- and about 50 percent greater as a proportion of population than it is in the United States."  &#10;&#10;The issue in the UK, as in America, is the character of the country. It isn\'t about resurgent "nativism," the label applied to some people who want to maintain the traditions, honor the history, save the English language and preserve other characteristics that make our countries attractive to residents and immigrants. No nation can long endure with unsecured borders.  &#10;&#10;The Wall Street Journal recently suggested that Cameron might consider slashing the 20 percent value-added tax on consumption, "which disproportionately affects those with lower incomes." For that matter the VAT could be slashed altogether to create an economic boom, but that\'s a subject for another day.  &#10;&#10;It isn\'t xenophobic to suggest that immigrants ought to leave their political and other interests behind when they arrive in a new land. That\'s what immigrants to America did in the last century. They left their native countries because they believed America offered them and their children a better life. They intended to embrace all that is America, not hyphenate themselves into competing groups with dual loyalties.  &#10;&#10;Immigrants who wish to become fully British or fully American are the kind of people our countries want. What they don\'t want are people who bring their agendas and seek to impose them on citizens who, through military service and sacrifice, built something they wish to sustain for themselves and their posterity.  &#10;&#10;Is that too much to ask?  	Nigel Farage, leader of the upstart UK Independent Party (UKIP), has been&#10;turning up the heat on British Prime Minister David Cameron over the issue of&#10;migrants who come to the UK without jobs and immediately sign up for&#10;government benefits.&#10;&#10;
120-immigrationpopulationgrowthlon	guardian	2015-01-06T11:39:03Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/06/immigration-population-growth-london-1939	David Lammy	More immigration and population growth? London can take it	Listen to the doomsayers, the scaremongers and the Farage brigade, and you would be forgiven for thinking that London is full. Our capital, just like our country, they say, can’t cope with any more people.  &#10;&#10;Everything from traffic jams to NHS waiting times is blamed on immigrants. The only answer, they tell us, is to pull up the drawbridge and close our borders, turning our back on the globalised world that this country did so much to create.  &#10;&#10;How, then, do they explain the fact that, according to forecasts, only today will London’s population surpass that of 1939 – topping 8.6 million for the first time? It is a stark rebuttal of the frequently peddled myth that says London must stop growing.  &#10;&#10;Instead of the huge influx of immigrants that headlines wrongly report, in reality the capital’s population has only gradually been creeping back to the level of 75 years ago, before the blitz destroyed many parts of the city.  &#10;&#10;Today, though, shows more than just the falsity of the immigration scare stories – it highlights the huge success of London as a city. Our capital continues to attract people from all over the country and all over the globe because of the opportunities it offers: to find work, set down roots, enjoy a world-class cultural scene and be accepted regardless of who you are and where you come from. That success should be a cause of great celebration, not something to curse and try to curtail.  &#10;&#10;But no one should deny the pressures that come with a growing population – pressures that are particularly acute in the capital. London is in the midst of the deepest housing crisis in decades, as average house prices soar to 14 times the average salary and rents rise uncontrollably. The city’s transport system is struggling to cope with demand, with commuters crammed into conditions in which it would be illegal to transport livestock, and fares rising year on year. The opportunities to get a decent job, buy a house, and enjoy all the city has to offer are becoming fewer. The reality is becoming detached from the dream.  &#10;&#10;These problems arise not because of growing demand alone but because of the failure of political leaders to respond to it. Londoners have a right to expect more from their mayor than the 17,000 new homes that were built in the capital last year – less than a third of the 63,000 a year that are needed to solve the city’s housing crisis. That Boris Johnson has missed his own affordable housing targets in every year of his mayoralty is an abject failure of political leadership. The government’s unwillingness to commit to vital transport infrastructure, such as Crossrail 2 and new Thames bridges, is scarcely better.  &#10;&#10;History shows us what can be achieved when politicians take population growth seriously and rise to the challenges it creates. In the midst of the second world war, even as bombs fell and the city burned, a plan was devised to respond to London’s growth. The Abercrombie plan, officially called the Greater London plan, laid out an ambitious vision for a new postwar London: decent housing replacing slums, efficient transport, full employment, new parks and open spaces. It was a radical and comprehensive document that provided the detail for rebuilding London after the devastation of the war. New towns including Stevenage and Crawley were built in the south-east; modern transport infrastructure, including the north and south circular roads, was planned to cope with the increasing number of cars. The requirements of a successful London were drawn up and implemented.  &#10;&#10;A growing population and new pressures on services mean we need a new, equally ambitious plan today. Empty words about more homes and better jobs will not cut it; they are no substitute for a serious and detailed proposal for building at least 63,000 homes a year and rebalancing the city’s economy to create jobs and opportunities for Londoners while continuing to invest in the industries of tomorrow.  &#10;&#10;The city’s creaking transport system must be upgraded, with Crossrail 2 and other new infrastructure built. This must happen without the continuous and excessive raising of fares, which burns holes in Londoners’ pockets. Keeping London affordable for ordinary people must be central to the plan, and improving the quality of life of Londoners a core theme. Given that London successfully adapted to growing demands in the middle of a world war, we can be optimistic about our chances of doing the same today.  &#10;&#10;We should not let those with a political agenda use London’s growing population to support their anti-immigration rhetoric, and we should challenge those who want to label London’s global attraction a flaw rather than a strength. That our capital is back at its peak population is a sign of its success as a great global city. People from all corners of the globe still take great risks, at great expense, to become Londoners and to benefit from the city’s opportunities. But this isn’t a time for complacency.  &#10;&#10;Whoever the next mayor is, they must focus their gaze on solving the problems that stem from growing demand on London’s infrastructure. As population continues towards 10 million, we need a new plan to take London forward together according to the qualities of the city at its best: inclusive, diverse, ambitious, forward-looking and offering a wealth of opportunities to all who live here.  	David Lammy: We must refuse to allow those with a political agenda to misuse the figures to support anti-migrant rhetoric – the capital had the same number of people in 1939
121-indiamassconversionproblem	aljazeera	Sun, 04 Jan 2015 01:20:55 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/01/india-mass-conversion-problem-20151274531627294.html	Saurav Datta 	India's mass conversion problem	"Homecoming" in the Christmas season is supposed to be a joyous occasion, accompanied by camaraderie and cheer. Not so for the small community of Christians in Agra, a town in the northern Indian province of Uttar Pradesh. On Christmas Eve, the flock of believers were cowering in fear, because a couple of churches were burnt and there was the looming threat of more skirmishes with the belligerent among their Hindu brethren spiralling into serious communal clashes.  &#10;&#10;More portentous was the grand ghar wapsi (homecoming, or mass-reconversion) programme announced by the Dharam Jagran Samiti (loosely translated into Hindi-Religious Awakening Front) in the neighbouring town of Aligarh, where Christmas was to be "celebrated" by bringing 4,000 Christians and 1,000 Muslims back into the folds of Hinduism.  &#10;&#10;This Samiti, a not-so-small wing of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, a militant Hindu organisation, contended that far from propagating religious intolerance, it was only righting historical wrongs and injustice perpetrated by Christian missionaries and Muslim clerics who, in order to bolster the numbers of their respective faiths, had lured and coerced Hindus to stray from their original religion.  &#10;&#10;Attack on secularism  &#10;&#10;When these turn of events created a furore in parliament, the Narendra Modi- led central government instructed the local administration to thwart the Samiti's grandiose plans, and Christmas day went peacefully.  &#10;&#10;But, the solution - a national legislation to ban and criminalise conversions - assertively advocated by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which commands an absolute majority in parliament, and despite repeated disavowals, remains rooted in essentially a chauvinistic, right-wing Hindu ideology, is far more disconcerting, and if implemented, would deal a grievous blow to the constitutional ideal of secularism.  &#10;&#10;It would be downright specious, even dishonest, to claim that missionaries and proselytisers' activities in India had nothing but a salubrious effect. Historical records bear ample testimony to the rigorous implementation of St Caprion's axiom - "extra ecclessium nulla salus" (outside the Church, no salvation), even by the proverbial fire and sword, especially by explorer-cum- conquistadors like Vasco da Gama, the tales of whose brutalities in enforcing a harvest of faith in the erstwhile Portuguese-controlled state of Goa are legion.  &#10;&#10;Active proselytisation was an integral part of the colonial project; indeed, as historian Ranajit Guha states, "the Bible and the toothbrush were one of the main instruments of the British colonialists".  &#10;&#10;This reveals that the missionaries did bring "material" gifts to the native population - especially western medicine and hygiene. But these benefits aside, there was another more substantive reason why many Indians, especially the Dalits (Untouchables) and tribals embraced Christianity, and even Islam.  &#10;&#10;Both these religions liberate them, or at least hold out the promise of unshackling them from the pernicious burden of the caste-system which is so deeply entrenched in Hinduism.  &#10;&#10;Though ostensibly secular in objective, the anti-conversion laws in force in various states of India - Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh (all areas with a significantly high population of tribals, Dalits, the depressed castes, and reeling from poverty, illiteracy and abysmal healthcare) in effect gives the government a vast swathe of control over people's choices in matters of faith and religion.  &#10;&#10;Going way beyond, they endow the government with surveillance powers over a constituency of people.  &#10;&#10;Starting from the premise that the freedom of religion and religious chose of "those who are converted" (note; the laws never say "those who convert") need to be protected from incursions of proselytisers - the various anti-conversion legislations, ironically termed as "freedom of religion" laws - make it mandatory for the convertees to inform the head of the district administration.  &#10;&#10;They will then give the go-ahead only once he is satisfied that one is not swapping religions for monetary benefits or other inducements, or by being taken in by fraud, or being swayed by either promises of salvation or threats of incurring divine displeasure, as the case may be.  &#10;&#10;The laws of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh make it incumbent upon neighbours or villagers to inform the administration and the police of any activities of pastors, nuns and clergymen which could give rise to a suspicion of proselytising motives. Without defining what all would, and could, possibly count as "inducement" or "fraud", these laws impose stringent criminal sanctions on violators.  &#10;&#10;Anyone found guilty is visited with imprisonment extending to three years, and with a financial penalty of 50,000 rupees (approximately $800).  &#10;&#10;Tellingly, the punishment is doubled if those who convert are women, or members of the lower castes and tribal communities. These laws are invoked and enforced only when a group of people, not individuals, seek to move out of Hinduism. One might well question - in face of such provisions, do the laws even need to use the modifiers "forcible" or "fraudulent"?  &#10;&#10;Also, not a single legislation even addresses, let alone punish, "reconversion" which the many Hindu zealots are painstakingly claiming as totally voluntary and a righteous reply to the violation of rights by colonisers and their ilk.  &#10;&#10;Indians look up to the judiciary to uphold the secular values of the republic, and the Supreme Court has, time and again, thwarted onslaughts on people's core fundamental right of religious freedom. But its record in adjudicating the evidently unsecular anti-conversion statutes is dubious. The last time it did was in 1977, in the Reverend Stanislaus case, wherein the Odisha and Madhya Pradesh statutes were upheld.  &#10;&#10;Basing its ruling on a 1956 report entitled "Report of the Christian Missionaries Activity Enquiry Commission", which deemed proselytisation as a threat to India's territorial integrity and internal security, the court ended up conflating every act of propagation of one's faith - Christianity, in this case (enshrined as a fundamental right in the constitution) as an attack on Hinduism and its followers, tantamount to blasphemy, which, incidentally, is also a criminal offence in India.  &#10;&#10;A national anti-conversion law, if enacted, would definitely be challenged in the Supreme Court. In that case, the judges could remedy the errors of 1977 by seeking inspiration from the European Court of Human Right's 1993 ruling in the Kokkinakis case, which struck the right balance between keeping out improper proselytism and Christians' right to practise, profess, and propagate their faith.  	Besides being overtly anti-Christian, the proposed anti-conversion law would&#10;negate the constitution's secular values.&#10;&#10;
122-indiangovernmentfightsavemahan	guardian	2015-01-14T16:26:06Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/14/indian-government-fight-save-mahan-forests-coal-mine-greenpeace	Priya Pillai	The Indian government won’t stop my fight to save Mahan’s forests	Mahan in Madhya Pradesh is one of the oldest and largest sal forests in Asia. The local communities are dependent on the forest for their livelihoods and it is also home to several rare and endangered species. But a portion of this reserve is earmarked for open cast coal mining by Essar, a British company registered in London.  &#10;&#10;In order to mine for coal, they would need to cut down the forest and displace those who live there. Essar would destroy more than 1,000 hectares of pristine forests and the biodiversity that it supports, affecting 54 villages. It would also impact on the livelihoods of thousands more who depend on forest produce, and the wildlife, water and air in the region.  &#10;&#10;For the last three years I have been helping villagers in Mahan to assert their rights, protect their forest, and prevent the open-cast coalmine development. Unfortunately, during this time, I have experienced a wide range of intimidation tactics. I have received anonymous phone calls threatening violence and been followed by a car without a number plate as I travelled to village meetings. Last year I discovered that a forged letter bearing my signature had been given to local media. It called on villagers to resort to violence while protesting against the mine.  &#10;&#10;And Greenpeace India is currently appealing against a decision by the home ministry to freeze all its overseas funding, some 40% of its income.  &#10;&#10;But Sunday marked a new low. I was due to travel to London to address British parliamentarians about my work with local Mahan communities, but I was not allowed to board my flight despite having valid travel documents. My passport was stamped with “offloaded” at the airport and I was asked to go home. The only explanation offered was that this was being done by the orders of the government of India.  &#10;&#10;Since then, I have consulted lawyers and written to government agencies. I’ve had no official response, but some newspapers reported that I have been put on a “blacklist” or “lookout list” preventing me from leaving the country. Such lists are usually for those with criminal convictions and I don’t have one.  &#10;&#10;Refusing my travel to speak to British MPs with no legal reason to do so is an infringement on my fundamental rights, and a shocking blow to the strength and freedom of civil society in India. My travel was legitimate. Essar is based in London and I was invited by a British all-party parliamentary group to talk about my work and to present the social and environmental impacts of the project – otherwise known as freedom of speech. We are equally engaged with all major parties and relevant politicians and administrators in India on this issue.  &#10;&#10;The fight in Mahan is about the rights of those people who live there and depend on the forest for their livelihoods. The local community is only asking that due process is followed: under Indian law there must be a local referendum and consent from the local community. But these laws have been bypassed, and now the government is reviewing major environmental laws, including the Forest Rights Act, that have been key in protecting forest dwellers. This is why a fight such as Mahan in India is critical. It’s symptomatic of how India will act when it comes to making important decisions about forests, conservation, community rights and a sustainable way of development.  &#10;&#10;The act of engaging all relevant stakeholders is part of my work as a Greenpeace member and indeed the responsibility of any vibrant civil society in any functional democracy. Travelling to London to meet British MPs was neither an attack on the Indian government, nor a violation of the laws of our country.  &#10;&#10;Internationally, India is under a lot of pressure to make strong commitments to tackling climate change, yet it is drawn to the cheap and immediate gains of coal despite the high social and environmental cost. Groups such as Greenpeace are a vital check on the power of corporations and politicians. We fight for Indian values promoting empowered local communities and a clean environment for the next generation. And our campaigns, such as the push to get pesticides out of our tea, have been successful. That’s why we’re being attacked.  &#10;&#10;In a week’s time, Greenpeace India will find out if its appeal against the Indian government freezing its funding is successful. If not, other campaign groups will be next.  &#10;&#10;Whatever the outcome, I will continue to support the rights of communities using all the democratic rights available to me. I will also continue to seek answers as to why I was blacklisted. One thing is clear; without a legal basis to justify my detention, the government is on thin ice. As I write this, it is busy shifting blame from one department to another. As we say in Mahan, we will fight and we will win.  	Priya Pillai: I may have been barred from travelling to the UK but the Greenpeace campaign against a coal mine in one of our oldest forests will go on
123-internetmosaicteensbuildidenti	guardian	2015-01-12T16:30:09Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/12/internet-mosaic-teens-build-identity	Jess Zimmerman	The internet is fertile ground for the mosaic of allegiances out of which teens build identity	The internet was barely a thing when my friends and I were kids; we passed physical notes and wrote letters to keep in touch. We knew on some level there was a chance they might one day be read by someone for whom they weren’t intended – we used to joke about our correspondence someday being published as “Collected Letters”, because like any teens, we were always performing. But unlike Twitter or Tumblr or the now-semi-moribund Livejournal, that public audience remained imaginary. (Well, at least until now; I have known my most frequent teen pen pals for 20 years, and we sometimes haul out our shoeboxes full of embarrassing juvenilia and enjoy cringing together.)  &#10;&#10;Young people – at least weird young people, at very least weird young girls – are often eager to announce themselves. In lieu of a strong self-concept, the young build themselves out of a mosaic of allegiances. The online world is fertile ground for these. Tumblr, Twitter and 4chan, for example, are full of young people pledging fervent allegiance to a favorite fan culture, a political movement or a self-diagnosis, with all the rights, privileges, and rivalries that implies. Some of these will be important parts of a person’s identity for life. Others will mortify them within a year. At that age, it can be very, very hard to tell which will be which.  &#10;&#10;Building a self-concept means staking your claim for an audience, however small. I’m sure kids still write private stuff. But it’s hard when you are young and lonely – no matter how many fandoms you join – to resist a readily- available audience that doubles as a support group. I wouldn’t have been able to, I think: I wrote letters, but if there had been Tumblr back then, I would have been on it like scarves on Sherlock.  &#10;&#10;The support of the invisible masses can be incredibly positive. For teens who are isolated physically or emotionally, the internet might provide the first glimmer of understanding that there’s nothing actually wrong with them. It can be a way to connect with other people, to build support systems to which you don’t have access in your offline life, a way to live and explore an identity that you might have to keep hidden or secret for your own protection.  &#10;&#10;But there can also be pitfalls. Sometimes, when you’re trying to figure out who you are and what you believe, you test out a lot of convictions. (I had an “I hate feminists because they get mad when men hold doors for them” phase, for example.) Once you’ve made those statements in public, it’s harder to pull up, to nix one bit of the person you’ve created from scratch and go exploring down a different route. You’ve already told Tumblr that you are definitely, really a wolf with wings; you’ve argued in favor of Otherkin rights and awareness; you’ve become a leader of the Otherkin community. Or worse, you’ve helped your 4chan buddies dox a female game developer and your rape-threat tweets are screencapped and re-tweeted all over the internet. You’ve pledged allegiance, and everyone saw you do it. Now, when someone challenges you, you have to double down.  &#10;&#10;The danger of overcommitting to passing thoughts by making them public isn’t just a pitfall for teens. Adults do it all the time – they make an offhanded comment and then make it worse with a defensive non-apology, or complain about an offhanded comment and set off the outrage machine. But the teen years are an identities factory, churning out new products right and left. You try out more opinions and self-concepts, and you’re much more susceptible to peer pressure. It’s perfect lab conditions for getting locked into an idea of yourself that would have otherwise been ephemeral.  &#10;&#10;I’m not saying we should keep teenagers off the internet. Teens are the internet’s beating heart, and they always have been; an internet without teens doesn’t bear thinking about. Besides, young people who are marginalized, or confused, or in any way lonely need to see that there is a whole world they can connect to – that there are people who share their problems, or maybe that their idiosyncrasies aren’t problems at all.  &#10;&#10;In an ideal world we’d keep adults off the internet instead, to preserve it as a space of identity experimentation for the people who really need that. Given that adults are unlikely to accept this idea, maybe we can all go back to using cute handles like LadyBloodrayne instead of our real names all the time. (I don’t know, I was a goth.) If she embarrasses you, ditch her for TitaniaDarkwing! If she gets you in trouble, switch to EldritchAngel! Actually, don’t: I like that one, and I’m keeping it.  &#10;&#10;At any rate, I hope that young people – at least lonely, weird young people, at very least lonely weird young girls – occasionally resist some of their urges for public self-declaration. I hope they’re writing emails to friends, even ones they’ve never met in person. In my ideal world they’d even take up writing letters again. Cobbling together an identity is a fraught, uncertain, often very retroactively embarrassing pursuit. I hope that the young weirdos of today can be kind enough to their future selves to draw a decorous veil over some of that floundering. At least until 20 years in the future, when it becomes funny again.  	Jess Zimmerman: Your teen years are a time to try on a bunch of different self-concepts. Today, you have to be careful when the internet doesn’t want you to change

Instability in Yemen, Libya, Syria and Iraq are case-in-point examples that Iran can realise its short and long-term objectives to become the region's main hegemon. Surrounded by countries with significant Shia minorities, Iran seeks to cultivate the image of "protector state" for these populations. And eventually, Iran could become the "core country" in this hotly contested region.  &#10;&#10;Toward this end, Iran has stirred Shia-Sunni divisions, creating sectarian identities for the various clashing groups. In the case of Yemen, this was done within the borders of one country where Iran contrived to create a distinct Shia identity for the Houthis who ended up taking control over the course of the past few months.  &#10;&#10;The Iranian strategy is focused on building a new political model in the region - one that relies on Iran's "centrality" through which it can exercise power and influence both on the regional and international levels.  &#10;&#10;Especially after the election of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Iran has been keen to develop working relations with the West and the US (particularly with regard to "fighting terrorism" - as it had done before in Afghanistan). It is also eager to play a similar role in Iraq.  &#10;&#10;This Iranian eagerness, however, cannot be isolated from the larger vision. This vision sees such cooperation as advancing the Iranian model of emphasising its geopolitical centrality for Shiism, as well as its hegemonic desires over the region, including the Arab Sunni states.  &#10;&#10;To become the centre of gravity of the Middle East, Iran needs to amplify its role as both a protector and hegemon for its much weaker and unstable Arab neighbours. These neighbours would be relegated within the Iranian model to the status of periphery states.  &#10;&#10;To do that, Iran uses its old revolutionary rhetoric and slogans to describe its brand of Islam as "authentic and original" while describing pro-West Sunni Arab states as having an "American-Islam", which it presents as an illegitimate form of Islam.  &#10;&#10;In his Washington Post op-ed last September, "Time to Engage", Rouhani outlined the Iranian objectives and the key areas in which Iran can cooperate with the US and the West. Although Rouhani laid out the Iranian strategic perspective and the parameters through which Iran can work and cooperate with the West, there was an important point, which he left unsaid.  &#10;&#10;He was essentially saying that the US must recognise the failure of its old policies, especially in the region, and at the same time tacitly acknowledged that Iran had made mistakes in dealing with the US during the past eight years. Nevertheless, he opened the door for US-Iranian cooperation on combating terrorism and emphasised the Iranian role in solving the region's thorniest problems, such as the Palestinian cause and the conflict with Israel.  &#10;&#10;View of superiority  &#10;&#10;Current Iranian discourse - political and cultural - revolves around advancing the view of superiority of the Iranian race, Shia Islam, and Iranian culture. Such discourse focuses on the uniqueness of the Iranian race as one that is steeped in civilisation, juxtaposed with the Arabs who represent, according to this view, the "other", i.e. less civilised.  &#10;&#10;In realpolitik terms, amid the instability and chaos plaguing Arab states, Iran presents itself as the alternative power to fill the vacuum in the region. From the Iranian perspective, the US has failed to solve many of the international crises and in some cases, it has created them. Iran, in this respect, is positioning itself as a rising power that will replace the US as the dominant power in the region.  &#10;&#10;Echoing such discourse, Kazem Sajjadpour, an advisor on Strategic Affairs to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Iran said, in Persian, during his participation in the roundtable discussion on the website Shia News Association, that while the Arab world suffers from fragmentation and strategic paralysis - while under the influence of western powers - Iran enjoys territorial integrity and cohesiveness, and is endowed with strategic resources.  &#10;&#10;All of these are factors that could make Iran the new rising power in the region. Indeed, Iran is making the case that the entire Arab world revolves around it - and cannot survive without it.  	Iran presents itself as an alternative power to fill the vacuum in a region&#10;rocked by instability and chaos.&#10;&#10;

Despite these denials, there is an ironic element to this strike that both sides cannot deny. The Islamic Republic of Iran used US-produced, Vietnam-era F-4 Phantom aircraft against a common foe, ISIL.  &#10;&#10;Contextualising these Iranian air strikes within the greater history of how these planes ended up in the Iranian air force in the first place demonstrates a geostrategic reality for US foreign policy: Iran's geographical depth means the US has needed Iran during both the Cold War and post-Cold War era, regardless of the government in Tehran.  &#10;&#10;The Islamic Republic's fleet of F-4s and F-14s were inherited from the Royal Iranian Air Force of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi. Iran under the shah was one of the few US allies that could purchase the advanced F-14 Tomcat interceptor of "Top Gun" fame, with one of the most sophisticated radars at the time.  &#10;&#10;The shah's shopping list of US-supplied aircraft boosted the economy of the US defence industry, as well as served US geopolitical interests during the Cold War. Iran's advanced military allowed it to emerge as a regional hegemon. Since it shared a long border with the Soviet Union, the shah's armed forces served as a bulwark against Communist penetration in the Middle East and the oil-rich Gulf region, and a deterrent against an anti-western Baathist Iraq.  &#10;&#10;Iran's geostrategic location has not diminished as a result of the collapse of the Soviet Union. No US or NATO ally, including Israel, Turkey or Saudi Arabia can cover Iran's geographical depth.  &#10;&#10;Iran's location means it can influence events from Iraq to the Gulf, from the Caucasus and adjoining Caspian and Black Seas to Central Asia, and from Afghanistan to South Asia.  &#10;&#10;Video footage  &#10;&#10;The video footage released by Al Jazeera of Iranian F-4s attacking ISIL forces in Iraq's Diyala province is reminiscent of another attack when two of the same US-supplied Iranian aircraft bombed Iraq's nuclear facility in Tuwaitha in 1980, during the first year of the Iran-Iraq War.  &#10;&#10;In this first air strike, the US and the Islamic Republic shared the same interests, albeit for different purposes. The Islamic Republic feared Iraq could develop a nuclear option as it fought a two-front war for its survival, including a domestic Iranian Kurdish uprising, and a potential pro-shah counterrevolution launched from within the Iranian air force - the same unit that was needed to target Iraq. The US, despite its tensions with Iran during the hostage crisis, did not want to see Iraq develop a nuclear capability that could threaten its ally Israel during the 1980s.  &#10;&#10;Israel successfully followed up the attack against Iraq's nuclear facility in 1981, and the US-led air strikes during the 1991 Gulf war were designed to destroy this nuclear infrastructure again, which had been rebuilt despite the Israeli air raid. Thus the air raid Iran conducted against ISIL was not the first time both Washington and the Islamic Republic might have both wished for a successful sortie of Iranian F-4 pilots.  &#10;&#10;Despite this common interest during the Iran-Iraq War, the US titled towards Iraq and directly engaged Iranian naval forces in the Gulf to protect Kuwaiti oil vessels, downing an Iranian civilian aircraft in the process. Iran fought a proxy war against US forces in Iraq following the 2003 Iraq war by supporting Iraqi militias during the insurgency.  &#10;&#10;Both the US and Iran will continue to clash over their respective relationships with Israel. Yet despite these differences both the US and Iran cooperated with each other to remove the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001. The joint cause against the Taliban in 2001, or ISIL in 2014, demonstrates that despite the decades-long mistrust and proxy conflicts between the two sides, geographical realpolitik can force both states to engage in alliances of convenience.  &#10;&#10;In an AP interview, the new US ambassador in Baghdad, Stuart Jones said, "Let’s face it. Iran is an important neighbour to Iraq. There has to be cooperation between Iran and Iraq." Such a statement is significant. The Iranian government has been trying to force the US to concede this geographic fact since 2003.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;Indirect evidence  &#10;&#10;This statement serves as indirect evidence that the US and Iran appear to have worked out a modus vivendi in dealing with ISIL in Iraq. Yet when Al Jazeera released the video of the air strike, the Iranian government initially denied the report, only to confirm it days later, adding the caveat that it was launched at the behest of the central government in Iraq.  &#10;&#10;The initial denial raises the question as to whether Iran did not want to upset this alliance of convenience with US by launching its own air strikes. In this case, rather than upsetting the US, both the Iranian and Iraqi governments probably wanted to keep this air strike quiet for domestic Iraqi politics.  &#10;&#10;The close cooperation between the post-2003 Iraqi government and Iran has been criticised by critics within Iraq over the last decade as a surrender of Baghdad to "Safavis", a reference to the 16th century Shia dynasty in Iran that tried to secure what is today Iraq from the Ottomans.  &#10;&#10;This footage, along with pictures of Qassim Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Quds Force, training Iraqi forces on Iranian equipment used by both the Iraqi military and Shia militias, have only alienated Iraq's disenfranchised communities with whom Baghdad needs to ultimately reconcile.  &#10;&#10;This modus vivendi over Iraq will hinge on the future of the ongoing nuclear negotiations and the Syrian civil war. But in both cases, there could be an endgame that resolves the mutual antagonisms between Iran and the US. Media coverage acknowledges that despite Iranian-US cooperation in Iraq, they still support rival sides in the Syrian civil war. However, even in that conflict, they do share a mutual desire for that conflict to end with a political solution. Such a solution will save Iran from the huge financial costs of subsidising the Syrian military and end a conflict that the US has been hesitant to engage in since its onset in the summer of 2011.  &#10;&#10;Al Jazeera's correspondent in Iraq, Imran Khan, in an article in November raised the question: Are the US and Iran on the same side in Iraq? The answer to this question is not only a "yes" in Iraq, but could also be a "yes" in terms of the long-term stability of Syria and Afghanistan. It is domestic politics in both the US and Iran that prevent any official from saying this publicly.  	Iran's geographical depth means the US has needed the country during both the&#10;Cold War and post-Cold War era.&#10;&#10;
126-iransanctionsfightthreemythsno	foxnews	2015-01-21T13:12:51Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/01/21/iran-sanctions-fight-three-myths-no-lawmaker-should-believe/	Alireza Jafarzadeh	Iran Sanctions Fight: Three myths no lawmaker should believe	The expected congressional vote on a new sanctions bill against the Iranian regime has rekindled debate over Tehran\'s nuclear defiance and the best way to confront it. Congress has misgivings about a rogue regime intent on obtaining nuclear capability, and understandably wants to ensure that Washington does not strike a bad deal.  &#10;&#10;Some argue that a decisive approach toward Tehran will be counterproductive. But their position ignores historical lessons and stands on a number of myths that need to be debunked.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Myth #1: More sanctions on Iran will prompt the regime to unilaterally walk away from the talks.  &#10;&#10;Iran cannot afford to walk away because it is desperate and vulnerable. It has a genuine interest to secure the lifting of existing sanctions, which provided the initial impetus for the regime to talk. Then, too, cynics argued that sanctions would prompt Tehran to accelerate its nuclear activities.  &#10;&#10;The regime is playing a game of attrition, aiming to weaken U.S. resolve, win more concessions, and maintain its nuclear infrastructure. The bipartisan sanctions bill will force Tehran to consider speedy compliance.  &#10;&#10;This month, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani reiterated, "Breaking the anti- Iran sanctions is the only way to achieve national progress," acknowledging that Iran\'s devastated economy cannot endure the weight of further sanctions, especially after the recent decline in oil prices.  &#10;&#10;The mullahs are paranoid of a disenchanted population already on edge. With rampant unemployment, inflation, and loss of oil revenues, walking away from the talks is not an option, especially if a sanctions-in-waiting bill is hovering over their head.  &#10;&#10;Myth #2: With more sanctions, Tehran will blame Washington for sabotaging diplomacy, and start on the path towards war.  &#10;&#10;Even with slumping oil revenues - slashed by at least 45% - the official defense budget has jumped 30%, mostly allocated to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC). And, more money is being funneled into Syria and Iraq to execute Tehran\'s designs - a budget that is twice that of all the country\'s publically funded universities combined.  &#10;&#10;If sanctions fail to force Tehran to abandon key parts of its nuclear program after over a year of negotiations, then continued talks with no additional leverage will fail as well.  &#10;&#10;The IAEA still has no access to suspect nuclear sites and its questions remain unanswered. IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said in November 2014, “Iran has not provided any explanations that enable the Agency to clarify the outstanding practical measures, nor has it proposed any new practical measures in the next step of the Framework for Cooperation, despite several requests from the Agency.”  &#10;&#10;Senior U.S. officials have repeatedly stated that even without additional sanctions the chances for reaching an agreement with Iran is less that 50 percent. So, as Iran tries to wear out western negotiators, clearly, additional leverage from Congress is necessary, not counterproductive.  &#10;&#10;Myth #3: New sanctions will strengthen "hardliners" in Iran who want to sabotage a prospective deal.  &#10;&#10;This is perhaps the most enduring myth in Washington that has dangerously infected Iran policy. The idea that there are moderate elements in Iran\'s body politic, and the U.S. needs to reach out to them by making more concessions is ludicrous.  &#10;&#10;The oft-cited dichotomy between "hardliners" and "moderates" in Iran badly misrepresents a system whose elements are united in their strategic objectives.  &#10;&#10;Rouhani, himself a longtime confidant of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, was instructed by the latter to sign onto the Joint Plan of Action in November 2013. Foreign Minister Zarif told the Iranian Parliament earlier this month that he has the full trust of Khamenei to continue the negotiations.  &#10;&#10;Experience has shown that diplomacy without leverage has never worked with dictators, especially in Tehran.  &#10;&#10;This puts Congress on the right path. The sanctions bill can be a game- changer. It will strengthen Washington\'s hand while helping to peacefully arrest Tehran\'s advance towards the bomb. One thing is for certain: Tehran\'s nuclear objective is anything but a myth.  	The expected congressional vote on a new sanctions bill against the Iranian&#10;regime has rekindled debate over Tehran's nuclear defiance and the best way to&#10;confront it.&#10;&#10;
127-irantalksnucleargenevaus	aljazeera	Sun, 18 Jan 2015 11:10:10 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/01/iran-talks-nuclear-geneva-us-201511851117786580.html	Massoumeh Torfeh	Iran talks: Moving beyond 'worn out' policies	The stakes are high in the latest round of nuclear talks starting today in Geneva between Iran and the P5+1 at the deputy foreign minister level. Over the past week, US Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Jawed Zarif have held long conversations in Geneva and Paris, lasting over seven hours. Both realise that more flexibility is required to avoid the break up of the talks.  &#10;&#10;British Prime Minister David Cameron spoke on the subject with US President Barack Obama and the foreign ministers of France, Germany and the EU foreign policy chief all held talks separately with Zarif. Yet if both sides continue to stick to their strict red lines it is questionable whether this round of talks will be any better than the last. It may be time for more flexible red lines if failure is to be avoided.  &#10;&#10;"Chances are less than 50/50," admits Obama, in a joint press conference with the British Prime Minister David Cameron when both leaders spent well over half of their press conferences spelling out what was at stake if a deal with Iran was not finalised by the June deadline.  &#10;&#10;Obama explained how "the most successful, the most effective sanctions regime" had eventually led Iran to the negotiating table. He said: "If we can get a verifiable deal with the necessary assurances then that would be the best deal."  &#10;&#10;Yet Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson said sanctions are a "worn out policy" and asked the White House to adopt a "logical approach".  &#10;&#10;Iran would not accept a deal that constrains its enrichment programme without the West reducing sanctions.  &#10;&#10;"Now we have come to a stage in the talks that requires the other side to take its decision to enable us to move forward," said Zarif when arriving in Geneva. "There needs to be some new and comprehensive proposals."  &#10;&#10;The latest directive from Iran's leader, Ali Khamenei is that officials "should take away the weapon of sanctions from the enemy".  &#10;&#10;"Even one step in retreat will lead to enemy's advance," he said. He is angered that "Americans say flagrantly that even if Iran withdraws in the nuclear issue, the sanctions will not be lifted all together and at once".  &#10;&#10;Khamenei is referring to the main point of contention; the issue of the period of curbing Iran's enrichment programme in exchange for the lifting of four sets of sanctions imposed on Iran by the UN, EU and the US.  &#10;&#10;The US wants the curbing of sanctions to be in a period covering well over 10 years, closer to 20 or in "double digits" as US administration officials put it. This is to ensure Iran's breakout time is prolonged. Iran sees this as an attempt for forcing it to forego what it calls its peaceful enrichment programme.  &#10;&#10;It does not accept this long period of curbing its enrichment programme without the reciprocal reduction in sanctions. It is believed that the Iranian leader could be persuaded with anything below 10 years or a timeframe in a "single digit".  &#10;&#10;"Iran is deeply suspicious of the US and the West," said Obama. Mutual distrust is at the core of the failure of the unwillingness on both side to be flexible. Khamenei still refers to the US as "enemy" and the US continues to refuse to lift sanctions fearing Iran's return to enrichment. It is not clear if western trust has taken another blow from reports that Syria is still trying to make nuclear weapons and has been getting help from Iran and North Korea.  &#10;&#10;The two sides would not be able to reach an agreement especially when the US Congress is pushing daily for imposing further sanctions in support of the Israeli lobby.  &#10;&#10;Republican Senator Mark Kirk and Democratic Senator Robert Menendez are finalising a bill for tougher sanctions. Senator Bob Corker is also working on a bill to ensure the congress must approve any final deal with Iran.  &#10;&#10;Iran hardliners answer sanctions with the threat of enrichment.  &#10;&#10;"Further sanctions will result in a vote in the Iranian parliament for continuing enrichment," said Ali Larijani, the head of Judiciary.  &#10;&#10;"The enemies wanted to deprive Iran from its right to the nuclear technology and even resorted to military threats to this end."  &#10;&#10;Hardline members of parliament are proposing a bill to increase the uranium enrichment programme to 60 percent.  &#10;&#10;"I am not, repeat, not suggesting that we are in immediate war footing, should negotiations with Iran fail," said Obama. At the same time he made it clear he would veto any congressional attempts at new sanctions against Iran. "Hold your fire," he told the congress. "We must not jeopardise the chance" to get a verifiable deal with Iran.  &#10;&#10;Although Republicans now hold a 54-46 seat majority in the Senate, it is not clear whether there would manage to get the 67 votes required in the Senate to override an Obama veto of any Iran legislation.  &#10;&#10;In intensive meetings with his European counterpart, Zarif has no doubt conveyed to them that if there is no easing of the sanctions there would be little he could do back home. He has asked for "serious and brave decisions" in order to move forward.  &#10;&#10;The world has heard expressions of commitments and hope from Iran and the countries P5+1 for over a year now. Yet those brave words must be coupled either with more flexibility as recommended by experts or coupled alternatively with new ideas, new methods and possibly new redlines.  &#10;&#10;There is still time and several avenues are still open. For example there could be more direct involvement by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, in the form of a representative, a high calibre UN negotiator, who could add momentum to the talks and create synergy.  &#10;&#10;Otherwise it is difficult to see how the negotiators can come up with a solution if they have not managed it in the past 14 months.  	Without more flexible red lines, this round of Iran nuke talks will fail like&#10;all the others.&#10;&#10;

The two brothers have been identified as 32-year-old Said Kouachi and 34-year-old Cherif Kouachi.  &#10;&#10;This theory has been reinforced by eyewitness accounts of the men shouting "Allahu Akbar". The designer who was forced to let the assailants in says they told her they were with al-Qaeda, while, according to AFP, the police claim that one of the killers remarked: "We have avenged the prophet."  &#10;&#10;Why Prophet Muhammad would need anyone to "avenge" him is beyond me.  &#10;&#10;The prophet endured far more mockery, humiliation, insult and rejection during his lifetime without needing or ordering hitmen to defend his honour than that meted out by a group of equal-opportunity French cartoonists who despise and satirise all forms of organised religion.  &#10;&#10;Even if, like with Anders Breivik in Norway, the perpetrators turn out not to be linked to Islamist groups, the collateral damage to French and European Muslims has already been done, despite one of the fallen police officers being a Muslim.  &#10;&#10;With the strength of the Front National in France, UKIP in Britain and other anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant currents across Europe, a popular or populist backlash is almost inevitable.  &#10;&#10;In neighbouring Germany, the thousands of Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West (PEGIDA) who have turned out to rallies, though still small enough to be labelled a "flop", has set alarm bells ringing to the extent that strong counter protests have taken place.  &#10;&#10;Like Muslims who fantasise about an ahistorical caliphate, conservative Europeans who dream of a bygone utopia of a Europe uncontaminated by Islam or immigration, miss the reality that the "Islamisation of the West" occurred centuries ago.  &#10;&#10;Islamic civilisation is so hard-wired into Europe's cultural, social and intellectual DNA that it would be impossible to expunge its influence. The same applies in the other direction, in light of Christendom's and the West's powerful influence on Arab and Islamic society.  &#10;&#10;In addition to the philosophy, science, literature and art of the Muslim world which profoundly shaped the European Renaissance, Islamic culture had some far more unexpected and surprising influences on western civilisation.  &#10;&#10;One man in particular, for whom no statues or memorials stand anywhere in Europe and very few westerners have heard of, is possibly the most unsung cultural, style and musical icon in European history.  &#10;&#10;In the ninth century, Ziryab, Cordoba's most sought-after hipster, brought into vogue the idea of seasonal fashions, steering history's catwalk towards the fashion slavery of the 21st century.  &#10;&#10;This Sultan of Style also added a fifth pair of strings to the Arab "oud", paving the way to the European lute, which would become the modern guitar.  &#10;&#10;He also introduced Europe to the idea of dining etiquette, from table cloths and crystal decanters to the three-course meal.  &#10;&#10;Fashion, fine food and rhythm are not what Europeans tend to associate with Muslims or Islam today. Instead, they are haunted by images of fundamentalists, not fun-loving eccentrics, and fanatics, not fans of refined culture.  &#10;&#10;As someone who is well aware of the destructive influence of violent Islamism in the Middle East, I can, at a certain level, sympathise with fears in the West over radicalisation. But Islamic extremism is mostly a threat to Muslim societies, not to Europe, as a minority has never, in history, imposed its will on a majority, except in the form of a military conqueror.  &#10;&#10;This exaggerated sense of threat can be seen in the enormous hysteria in segments of the media and among some politicians regarding the small trickle of European jihadists who have gone to fight in Syria. Although one gets the impression that Europe has sent forth a veritable Islamic army to the Levant, the real number is around 3,000 from across the continent, including the dead and returned, according to an estimate by Gilles de Kerchove, the EU's anti- terrorism chief.  &#10;&#10;While it is important to be vigilant and to find effective ways to deal with the threat posed by returning fighters, society must steer clear of stigmatising Europe's already marginalised and distrusted Muslim communities.  &#10;&#10;This is because it is unfair to blame an entire group for the behaviour of a tiny minority and it is also counterproductive, as marginalisation is a significant, but not the only, factor in radicalisation.  &#10;&#10;In addition, the demonisation of minorities is what nurtures the truly threatening radicals in Europe's midst; the far-right and neo-Nazis. Since the end of World War II, Western Europe has worked consciously to build and celebrate diversity.  &#10;&#10;Despite its weaknesses and failings, Europe needs to cherish, build and strengthen its multicultural experiment.  	France must cherish its multicultural experiment.&#10;&#10;

Their announced reason is revenge for the defamation of the Prophet Muhammad. Their battle cry is the Arabic declaration that ‘Allah hu Akbar’ (Allah is the greatest!).  &#10;&#10;In the aftermath, White House spokesman Josh Earnest briefs the media on how his boss, President Obama, sees the slaughter in Paris.His diagnosis: A deplorable case of “terrorism.”  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Reporters notice a missing adjective. Has Earnest forgotten to mention something about the identity of the killers?  &#10;&#10;No, not at all, Earnest says. He is simply trying to be accurate. He explains (and I paraphrase) that the Paris assassins were just folks who happened to commit mass murder against some journalists (every spokesman’s fantasy—I speak from personal experience) and then, stuck for an explanation, invoked Islam. The proof that this had nothing to do with the Religion of Peace is that it was “roundly condemned by (unnamed) Muslim spiritual leaders.  &#10;&#10;Not since the hapless Ron Ziegler assured the press that his boss, Richard Nixon, was not a crook, has a White House spokesman been reduced to invoking the, “who-are-you-going- to- believe, me-or-your-lying-eyes,” defense in quite such a pitiful way.  &#10;&#10;The name “Josh Earnest” may not go down in history, but it is destined to become a "Jeopardy" answer: What presidential spokesman denied the existence of Islamic terrorism?  &#10;&#10;Of course Earnest did this in a good cause—keeping his job. And to be charitable, his boss probably has virtuous reasons for his see-no-evil approach, For one thing, he doesn’t want to insult American Muslims, who are his supporters. For another, he may imagine that he is protecting them from Tea Party pogroms, an abiding, if entirely imaginary, liberal concern.  &#10;&#10;It is likely that Obama also thinks that his discreet silence about who did what to whom in Paris is a boon the American fight for hearts and minds in the Middle East. If so, he is mistaken.Muslims from Nigeria to Chechnya know perfectly well that he is dissembling. Islam is the world’s leading exporter of political and religious violence. Some Muslims regret it; others see it as the fulfillment of a Koranic duty. Either way, they don’t expect the victims to pretend that the infidel bodies lying dead at their desks in Paris just happened to drop dead. Alibiing for Islam makes Obama come off like Freddo (“Moe didn’t mean nothin’ by slapping me around, Mikey, he’s a good guy. He’s sorry, right Moe?”) Corleone. Like Freddo, Obama can be bullied into silence and appeased by insincere apologies.  &#10;&#10;Just how insincere was evident a few days after the Paris massacre when the editors of Charlie Hebdo, in an act of startling courage, put another “offensive” cartoon of Mohammed on the cover of their magazine. Suddenly, it was back to yesterday in the House of Islam.Churches were torched by the faithful in Mali.Wild anti-Western rallies took place from Chechnya to Nigeria. The free-speech loving Imams and Ayatollahs of Josh Earnest’s imagination incited worshippers with cries of blasphemy and holy war. The New York Times, house organ of the Obama administration, responded by not publishing the caricature because “some readers” (unspecified) might be offended.  &#10;&#10;Such weakness is entirely transparent to the Muslim world—not only to the jihadis themselves, whose ranks are swelling with every attack but to their countless millions of admirers, apologists and silent supporters.  &#10;&#10;It is also completely clear to Israel.  &#10;&#10;For two years, Obama and Secretary of State Kerry have relentlessly and futilely tried to convince Jerusalem to withdraw from the West Bank and agree to the creation of a Palestinian state. The plan has been on life support for months; it died—at least for the duration of the Obama administration--in the kosher supermarket where four Jews were shot dead by a gunman inspired by the (non-denominational!) Islamic Caliphate of Iraq and Syria. The killer dedicated the job to the Palestinian people. The victims were buried in Jerusalem partly because their families feared their graves would be desecrated in France.  &#10;&#10;The funerals coincided with the start of the election season in Israel. Prime Minister Netanyahu, running for a fourth term, is implacably opposed to making concessions to the Palestinian Authority, one of whose components, Hamas, is a branch of the M-word Brotherhood. Obama has made it clear that he would like Netanyahu to lose. This is a good thing for the Prime Minister. Even the left understands that there can be no deal backed by an American Godfather who is who is scared of Moe Greene.  	Not since the hapless Ron Ziegler assured the press that his boss, Richard&#10;Nixon, was not a crook, has a White House spokesman been reduced to invoking&#10;the, “who-are-you-going- to- believe, me-or-your-lying-eyes,” defense in quite&#10;such a pitiful way.&#10;&#10;

I was too young to remember anything from the night of December 2, 1984, but, throughout the years, I have heard many stories from the people who were there and saw it happen. My sister would sometimes tell me things about that night, though we generally avoided bringing it up, as we knew that it would only hurt us to talk about it.  &#10;&#10;After the disaster, some of our relatives, who had heard about it on the radio, came and took us to Lucknow, around 600km from Bhopal. We stayed with them for a few months, but they started treating us badly, as if we were a burden to them and their families, so it was our brother Sunil, another survivor from our family of 10 - aged 13 at the time of the disaster - who decided to bring us back to Bhopal. Subsequently, we were sent to an orphanage in Bhopal, called The SOS Children's Village. Sunil refused to live with us in the orphanage, and got involved with the anti-Carbide campaign. He created an organisation called Children Against Carbide. Most of the members of this organisation were children from the community we were from - Jay Prakash Nagar (JP Nagar), right across the road from the main Bhopal plant.  &#10;&#10;I was happy with my life at the orphanage in Bhopal, I had almost everything: cricket bats, skates, football, good education etc. But, at the same time, I did not know anything about our parents.  &#10;&#10;In middle school, we would have parent-teacher meetings at school; my classmates had their parents next to them for the meeting, but I had no one next to me. It was around that time that I started asking my sister about our parents. It was then that my sister first told me about the Bhopal gas disaster and what had happened that night. Until then, I never fully understood that I was growing up in an orphanage and didn't really know the meaning of the word "orphanage".  &#10;&#10;My sister Mamta told me that there were four brothers and four sisters in our family. Our father was a carpenter, and I was the youngest in the family. We lost three sisters and two brothers along with our parents that night.  &#10;&#10;I then asked her, "How did we survive?"  &#10;&#10;She told me that she wrapped me in a blanket, and ran away along with our brother Sunil. When they were running, Sunil had to go to the bathroom, and fainted. The streets were so crowded as people were running and shouting, my sister was forced by the crowd, and couldn't wait any longer for my brother Sunil to come back.  &#10;&#10;He succeeded in 2006 when he hung himself.  &#10;&#10;So, now it is just Mamta and I - the only survivors from a family of 10.  &#10;&#10;Mamta lives in Lucknow with her husband and two children, and I live here in Bhopal on my own. She would often complain about severe headaches and eye problems.  &#10;&#10;It has been almost 30 years now, and Bhopalis are still fighting for their basic rights. The disaster took so many lives, and is still killing people, as the abandoned factory continues poisoning our soil, water, and air.  &#10;&#10;I started learning more about the disaster when I saw people of different ages chanting slogans in the streets of Bhopal when I was a child.  &#10;&#10;In 2004, Greenpeace flew me to Paris to participate in a demonstration outside Dow's shareholders meeting. I got involved with the campaign in 2004 partly because of my brother's participation in the campaign. It was better to die fighting for our rights than succumb to depression over what had happened.  &#10;&#10;I had a stroke in 2005, and started taking an aspirin everyday. I also had a pulmonary embolism in the US last year. Now I no longer take an aspirin, because now I have to take 7.5mg of warfarin, a blood thinner, which is also used as rat poison.  &#10;&#10;In 2008, I was one of a number of Bhopal survivors in New Delhi who fasted for 21 days, only having water. We were asking then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to set up an empowered commission to look into the issues related to Bhopal. We also wanted clean water to be supplied to the people who were living in the affected communities and were forced to drink contaminated water.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;Everyone on this earth should feel this anger and frustration. It has been 30 years and justice continues to elude the people of Bhopal. We, the people of Bhopal, believe that the whole world has transformed into a Bhopal in a way: If you look around, you see multinational corporations being allowed to do business without accountability, poisoning the world and placing profits over people. If justice comes to Bhopal, then it would be justice for the whole world. It would set a precedent and ensure that in the future, corporations committing such crimes are brought to justice.  	It has been 30 years and Bhopalis are still fighting for their basic rights.&#10;&#10;

Could this attack have been motivated by the editorial slant of the newspaper that has been subject to threats? Could this attack have been perpetrated by foreign groups to "punish" France for its commitment in Mali or Chad?  &#10;&#10;Police in France have identified and released the photographs of two brothers suspected to be involved in the attack while early speculation focused on the premise that Muslim extremists were behind the dreadful act, especially given the magazine's long history of satirising Islam and other religions. The two brothers have been identified as 32-year-old Said Kouachi and 34-year-old Cherif Kouachi.  &#10;&#10;This attack must be condemned with the utmost firmness and its perpetrators arrested and convicted. Nothing can justify such an act; whatever the reasons, whoever the perpetrators. But we also have to understand the context, as this aggression could arouse dangerous reactions within French society.  &#10;&#10;Charlie Hebdo was founded in February 1969. It was then politically positioned on the extreme left with anarchist tendencies and a taste for provocation. In November 1970, following the death of General de Gaulle, it published a cover with the headline: "Tragic prom in Colombey [de Gaulle's city of origin], one dead", which resulted in it being banned by the Ministry of Interior.  &#10;&#10;But since 2000, under its new editor Philippe Val, Charlie Hebdo shifted direction, taking a stand against the Palestinians and supporting the Israeli aggression against Lebanon in 2006... This came during the second Intifada.  &#10;&#10;At the same time, the newspaper started to launch Islamophobic campaigns. In 2006, it republished the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad that were previously published in Denmark.  &#10;&#10;A number of intellectuals then pointed out that while in France we cannot accept censorship, sometimes it can be irresponsible to publish drawings fuelling sectarian tensions in the country.  &#10;&#10;In March 2006, Val signed "The Twelve's Manifesto: Together Against the New Totalitarianism" published in the weekly magazine L'Express, by Bernard-Henri Levy, Caroline Fourest, and Antoine Sfeir.  &#10;&#10;"After having overcome Fascism, Nazism and Stalinism, the world now faces a new global threat of a totalitarian nature: Islamism. We - writers, journalists and intellectuals - call for resistance against religious totalitarianism and to promote freedom, equal opportunity and secular values for all."  &#10;&#10;But these positions divided the team and several members resigned. While claiming to stand for press freedom, Charlie Hebdo dismissed one of its star cartoonists, Sine, due to false accusations of anti-Semitism.  &#10;&#10;It then came as no surprise that, when elected, President Nicolas Sarkozy promoted Philippe Val to executive editor of France-Inter (a public radio station).  &#10;&#10;Nevertheless, press freedom cannot be compromised and the situation currently rocking Paris is all the more condemnable showing that this could have serious consequences on the internal situation in France. It may encourage a wave of Islamophobia that overwhelms the country - as well as other European countries - and could designate Muslims as the "internal enemy".  &#10;&#10;However, perhaps it is about time to engage in a substantive debate on the "war against terrorism" revived by the West and the "international community", in the aftermath of the expansion of ISIL.  &#10;&#10;Assessing the outcomes of such a campaign (more violent actions around the world, finding justifications for attacks on freedom, new anti-terrorism legislation, worsening sectarian tensions, more support for Middle East dictatorships and so on), isn't it about time to change our methods?  &#10;&#10;Remember, the wave of the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011 and 2012 resulted in a loss of credit for al-Qaeda, as they paved a path for political and democratic change in Arab countries.  	The problem with drawings that fuel sectarian tensions.&#10;&#10;
132-itnottimedismantlecia	aljazeera	Sun, 04 Jan 2015 10:45:05 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/01/it-not-time-dismantle-cia-2015144353434780.html	MJ Rosenberg	Is it not time to dismantle the CIA?	It's not as if we weren't warned about the CIA. Some 50 years before the Senate Intelligence Committee issued its 500-page report on torture, former President Harry Truman published an opinion piece in the Washington Post asserting that the CIA was out of control and calling for it to be broken up.  &#10;&#10;Truman's column appeared on December 22, 1963, a month to the day following US President John F Kennedy's assassination and 11 years after he himself moved out of the White House.  &#10;&#10;Truman argued, as the president who authorised its establishment in 1947, that the CIA had strayed from the mission he had intended for it.  &#10;&#10;He had favoured creation of the CIA so that a president would have one agency providing him with objective foreign intelligence, rather than having to rely upon the often conflicting information being served up by the Departments of State, Defense, and others who "slanted to conform to established positions of a given department".  &#10;&#10;Viewing intelligence gathering as its sole mission, Truman was disturbed "by the way the CIA has been diverted from its original assignment. It has become an operational and at times a policy-making arm of the government." He said he had "never had any thought" that the CIA would involve itself in "cloak and dagger operations". But it had which "has led to trouble and may have compounded our difficulties in several explosive areas".  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;It is clearly of some significance that Truman published his piece just one month after Kennedy's assassination. Although there is no evidence that Truman was suggesting CIA involvement in the assassination, it is impossible to believe that the late president's difficulties with the CIA were far from Truman's mind.  &#10;&#10;As a former president who the Kennedy White House regularly briefed on foreign policy issues and decisions, Truman knew how the CIA essentially steamrolled Kennedy into the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba (and other anti- Castro actions), leading Kennedy to tell a friend that he wanted "to splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds".  &#10;&#10;Kennedy never had the chance to follow up on that idea but it was essentially what Truman suggested a month after Kennedy's death.  &#10;&#10;Obviously, Truman's recommendation had no effect. In fact, the Washington establishment apparently took action to see that Truman's piece disappeared almost without a trace (easier in those pre-internet days).  &#10;&#10;According to former CIA analyst Ray McGovern, the Washington Post only published the piece in its morning edition, pulling it from view after that (a peculiar way to treat an opinion piece by a former president, especially on such a weighty issue).  &#10;&#10;McGovern also reports that former CIA Director Allen Dulles, who Kennedy fired after the Bay of Pigs debacle, actually flew down to Truman's home in Independence, Missouri to get the former president to retract.  &#10;&#10;Although Dulles reported back to his friends that Truman had indeed recanted, he clearly never did. In fact, six months after publishing the column in the Post, Truman wrote to the managing editor of Look Magazine that he intended the CIA as an intelligence gathering agency only and not a place where "strange activities" would be launched.  &#10;&#10;No doubt, the Bay of Pigs and Cuba, in general, were not the only examples of CIA interventions that disturbed Truman. In the years between the end of Truman's administration and his Washington Post column, the CIA had orchestrated the overthrow of governments in Iran (1953), Guatemala (1954), Congo (1960), Dominican Republic (1961), South Vietnam (1963), Brazil (1964). Within a year following Truman's death, the CIA successfully brought down the Allende government in Chile (1973).  &#10;&#10;As for its activities since, its intelligence activities have clearly continued to be a low priority (it has gotten Iraq wrong from the start, culminating most recently in its failure to predict the rise of ISIL) while, what Truman called its "cloak and dagger" operations, have proliferated.  &#10;&#10;According to historian William Blum, writing in Foreign Policy Journal, in the last 69 years, the CIA has (often in conjunction with the military) "(1) attempted to overthrow more than 50 governments, most of which were democratically-elected, (2) attempted to suppress a populist or nationalist movement in 20 countries, (3) grossly interfered in democratic elections in at least 30 countries, (4) dropped bombs on the people of more than 30 countries, (5) attempted to assassinate more than 50 foreign leaders."  &#10;&#10;And now there are the horrific reports of torture and, equally appalling, the defense of CIA torture by former CIA driectors, other top CIA officials and, most enthusiastically, former Vice President Dick Cheney who famously told NBC five days after 9/11 that it was now time for US intelligence agencies to operate on the "dark side".  &#10;&#10;That is the context of the torture debate. As Truman understood, the CIA was dangerous and should be broken up or, in Kennedy's words, "splinter[ed] into a thousand pieces and scatter[ed] to the winds". That was 50 years and nine presidents ago and since John F Kennedy, no president has challenged the CIA.  &#10;&#10;Perhaps each of them have understood there are battles that not even a president could win.  	A former US president wanted to break up the CIA after it strayed from its&#10;mission, engaging in 'strange activities'.&#10;&#10;
133-itpatriotismstupidwhatliberalc	foxnews	2015-01-28T18:15:19Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/01/28/it-patriotism-stupid-what-liberal-critics-dont-get-about-american-sniper/	Pete Hegseth	It's the patriotism, stupid. What liberal critics don't get about "American Sniper"	  &#10;&#10;There’s no denying it. Clint Eastwood’s “American Sniper” has struck a chord with the American people, and did so by tapping into the deepest civic values we have as Americans – duty, honor, fidelity, courage, love for country…and a love for others.  &#10;&#10;However, no war movie can live on the big screen without a spew of liberal backlash, and this film is no different. Criticism has come quickly from Michael Moore, Seth Rogen, former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean and other Hollywood leftists.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Thankfully, some things speak louder than cowardly tweets—like the more than $200 million in ticket sales the movie has raked in just one week. In fact, the new war film featuring Bradley Cooper as well-known Navy SEAL sniper, Chris Kyle, is on pace to become the top-grossing war film of all time.  &#10;&#10;As much as the left would like you to believe it, Chris Kyle was not a bloodthirsty warmonger; he was a noble warrior who fought to defend his fellow troops, watched over the lives of his brothers, and advanced the cause of (eventual) peace. This is where the true success of “American Sniper” comes to light.  &#10;&#10;The film is not a movie about the Iraq war, or whether we won or lost; or even whether our motivations were justified. Instead, it’s a story about a man and the many trials of war, including coming home from it. In the words of my good friend and former Army Ranger, Sean Parnell,“[American Sniper] isn’t a pro-war film. It’s a pro-warrior film.”  &#10;&#10;That’s the key. The movie is a testament to the warrior – to the man in the arena. Everyone criticizing the film is on the sidelines hurling insults. Chris was in the arena, fighting for us in a dangerous and complicated war.  &#10;&#10;Nonetheless, outspoken liberals will continue to cast judgment, saying that they support the warrior but not the war. But they contradict themselves even on that point. The left sees warriors—men like Chris Kyle—as bloodthirsty and ignorant Americans from fly-over country who cling to God and guns in blind support of our military. They dislike both the warandthe warrior.  &#10;&#10;Nothing could be further from the truth. In reality, middle-America is full of hard working people of faith and fidelity who love their nation and believe in celebrating someone like Chris Kyle. These are people who feel like they’re already taxed enough, that the government is over-bearing in their lives, that religion has been stripped from every aspect of civil society, and that the president is misguided in his gutting of their military. They are, in a word, patriots.  &#10;&#10;Despite their frustrations with leftists, middle America is the beating heart of our nation and remains the first in line to selflessly strap on their boots and defend the very freedoms that people like Michael Moore use to criticize them.  &#10;&#10;It’s awfully easy for progressives to cast criticism down from their isolated ivory towers, but next time they consider demeaning the warriors protecting them afar, as Chris Kyle once did, they may want to consider who protects those towers and keeps them from tumbling.  &#10;&#10;They’re not only the folks who see this movie, but more often than not, they’re the kind of people depicted in these movies. They’re the kind of people who embody “citizenship,” and the very idea of living and fighting for something bigger than oneself.  &#10;&#10;Chris Kyle understood that. Today’s servicemen and women understand that. And that’s why millions of people are seeing this movie. They want to celebrate and believe in America again, if only for two short hours in a crowded dark theater.  	There’s no denying it. Clint Eastwood’s “American Sniper” struck a chord with&#10;the American people, and did so by tapping into the deepest civic values we&#10;have as Americans – duty, honor, fidelity, courage, love for country…and a&#10;love for others.&#10;&#10;

(AP)  &#10;&#10;Jan 1. 2015: In this photo taken with a long time exposure, fireworks light the sky shortly after midnight during New Year's Eve celebrations in Erfurt, central Germany. (AP)  &#10;&#10;You see it everywhere this time of year: “Peace on Earth, Good Will to All People.”  &#10;&#10;Meanwhile, according to the British newspaper The Independent, only eleven countries on earth are free from violent conflict. There are more than twenty- five full-on wars happening right now and 169 violent militia and rebel conflicts.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Peace on Earth—when will it happen? It’s time to adopt an Alcoholics Anonymous approach to world peace.  &#10;&#10;According to scientists, for as long as there have been intoxicants, a portion of human beings has struggled with addiction. For millennia, various disciplines including medicine, psychiatry and religion attempted, unsuccessfully, to help people suffering from an addiction to booze. All of the approaches stemmed from the same common approach: Let’s resolve your problems so you’ll stop drinking.  &#10;&#10;Alcoholics Anonymous reversed this. A.A. has succeeded because it was the first to say, “Stop drinking FIRST and then we’ll work on your problems.” Thanks to this subtle shift, countless jobs, marriages, and even lives have been saved.  &#10;&#10;Heretofore, humanity’s approach to peace has been like outdated approaches to alcoholism. Attempts at peace have centered on, “Let’s resolve our differences so we can stop killing each other.” This has only lead to the discovery of more differences and more killing. It’s time we followed the example of recovery programs such as A.A. and resolve to, FIRST, stop killing each other and then we can work on our differences.  &#10;&#10;War is used as a tool of international policy because people accept it. All we have to do is change our minds—to cease to believe that war is an acceptable necessary evil and to begin to believe that no disagreement is worth killing each other’s children. Countries have been trying to resolve their differences so that there will no longer be war. We need to declare peace first and then spend eternity working out our differences. The option of war is simply removed from the table.  &#10;&#10;This is why I am declaring enduring world peace beginning September 21, 2056.  &#10;&#10;Seriously.  &#10;&#10;September 21st is the United Nations World Day of Peace—so there is already momentum there. We just need to turn those national celebrations into a countdown to world peace.  &#10;&#10;2056 is far enough in the future that it gives us time for enough people to make the requisite shift in belief such that peace will, indeed, reign on planet Earth.  &#10;&#10;Who am I to make such a proclamation? I’m just a writer and an ordained minister and there are crazy preachers who, every decade or so, declare the end of the world is coming on this or that date. So why can\'t I say when world peace will begin?  &#10;&#10;Incidentally, this is not a new idea. The Kellogg Briand Pact of 1927, sponsored by the United States and signed by 62 countries declared that war may not be used to resolve "disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be, which may arise.”  &#10;&#10;Every major religion shares a common belief in the sanctity of human life and yet war has endured. If enough people believe—just believe, that as of September 21, 2056 war will end on planet earth—it must happen!  &#10;&#10;If eleven, only eleven out of 196 countries are at peace, it still means that right now, in at least eleven countries there is peace. We simply need to build on this over the next forty-two years.  &#10;&#10;This year, when you say, “Peace on Earth,” give peace a beginning date.  	You see it everywhere this time of year: “Peace on Earth, Good Will to All&#10;People.” Meanwhile, according to the British newspaper The Independent, only&#10;eleven countries on earth are free from violent conflict. There are more than&#10;twenty-five full-on wars happening right now and 169 violent militia and rebel&#10;conflicts.&#10;&#10;

Now you’re rude if you do	Michael Gove is a difficult man to feel sorry for. It seems even his friends can’t always manage it. David Cameron, for example – I think he’s his friend. He’d definitely say he was Michael Gove’s friend but then, politicians being what they are, the fact that he’d say it doesn’t enormously increase the statistical chances of its being true. Anyway, they’re certainly political allies – or at least were, before Gove made his ill-judged remark about the “preposterous” number of the prime minister’s coterie who went to Eton, which ironically led Cameron to lose faith in about the only one who didn’t, Gove himself. “That’s what you get,” the PM must have muttered to himself, “for trusting oiks.”  &#10;&#10;Since then Gove’s slide down the greasy pole could hardly have been less dignified if he’d been wearing nipple tassels. Which, for all we know, he was. Like a former deputy headmaster who’s been busted down to head prefect, Gove not only has to remain loyal to a government that has scorned him but, as chief whip, he must also enforce loyalty in others.  &#10;&#10;But I didn’t feel sorry for him until last week when I read that his mobile phone had gone off during a cabinet meeting. This is obviously bad form: for security reasons, you’re not even supposed to bring phones into those gatherings. To make matters worse his ringtone is, according to someone who was there: “Jazz FM-style comedown music after a heavy night out”. I’m not entirely sure what that means, but it’s clearly some sort of tune. I’m going to imagine it as the theme from Bod.  &#10;&#10;So in the middle of some serious conversation about the Charlie Hebdo shootings or the economy or the NHS, while Vince Cable is expressing some “serious concerns” and everyone else is trying to make drooping eyelids look like they’re concentrating hard, suddenly it’s “Diddle-it-deduh-dede-duh-duh!” and Gove is jumping and wriggling like George Osborne’s Tasered him again. Gove’s seated twist having gone on “for quite a while”, the PM intervened with what one witness described as “a public bollocking”.  &#10;&#10;Even if Cameron could summon no compassion for his friend, I can. I sympathise with Michael Gove here, as a point of principle. I also sympathise with those people in West End theatres who are hit by a volley of rage and sarcasm from some knight of the stage when Nokia Tune has crashed in on his soliloquy. I sympathise whenever it happens at meetings, weddings, carol services or when someone’s tearfully coming out. I sympathise because one day it will happen to me.  &#10;&#10;However careful I am with my phone – and, as a slightly obsessive person, I’m pretty careful – there are times when I take it out, utterly convinced that it’s been switched off for hours, and find five bars beaming back from my hand, as incriminating as a gory dagger. Most of the time, I check it every 30 seconds. But sometimes I just don’t. My fastidious self-image deceives me into carelessness. At some point, I’m going to come a cropper. And when that shaming moment comes, as I fumble in my trousers by the heat of a hundred stares, I want to be surrounded by people who accept that this could happen to anyone, and might believe that this is an issue about which I’m at least averagely diligent.  &#10;&#10;That’s not how it’ll be, though. Our attitudes to accidental phone rings are stuck in the 80s. Even though the mobile has long since ceased to be a cutting-edge gadget possessed only by the high-earning early-adopting few, when one goes off inappropriately, we still visualise a shameless yuppie in red braces, Aston Martin double-parked outside, closing deals – an offensive symbol of profligate and faddish modernity.  &#10;&#10;This is hopelessly out of step with what these machines now mean to us. Research just published by a team at the University of Missouri shows that, when a sample of 40 people were temporarily deprived of their iPhones, their heart rate and blood pressure rose, and their ability to perform tasks suffered. Our mobiles, the paper suggests, are now “an extension of our physical selves, an umbilical cord, anchoring the information society’s digital infrastructure to our very bodies”. We hate to be parted from them and we don’t much like turning them off.  &#10;&#10;Many will lament this, but it’s not altogether bad. Our phones reassure us because they make us feel connected – because if your mobile is turned on, in range and not ringing, it probably means that no work crisis has developed and no disaster has befallen a close friend or loved one. It’s a constant everyone-in-your-life-is-more-or-less-OK monitor. Maybe we should learn to live without such reassurance, but it doesn’t reflect entirely badly on us that we’re comforted by it.  &#10;&#10;People often criticise one another for talking or texting on their phones in preference to live interaction. “We met for a coffee but she spent the whole time on the phone!” “We were having lunch and his mobile rang – and he actually answered it!” Such critics forget that, in the heyday of the landline, a ringing telephone – the phone in the hall – was always answered. The notion of call screening is entirely modern. It never used to be rude to answer – it was rude not to.  &#10;&#10;The onus of politeness, in those days, was on the caller. Except in an emergency, you didn’t telephone someone at a mealtime, during their favourite television programme or after 10 o’clock. When you thought someone might not want to be disturbed, you didn’t disturb them unless you had to. It’s the passing of that etiquette, rather than the prevalence of mobile phones, that I think is a shame.  &#10;&#10;Of course, in the age of the mobile, it’s impossible to know whether the person you’re calling will find it convenient to chat. You can’t know if they’re eating or in the cinema or reading the traffic news. So how about this: only call a mobile if you really need to. If you just want a chat, call a landline, and not during meals. So that, if “I Will Survive” starts blaring from your Android during an aunt’s funeral, it’s not you who’s been rude. And the person who has isn’t there.  &#10;&#10;David Mitchell’s new book, Thinking About It Only Makes It Worse, is published by Guardian Faber (£18.99).

It could just have easily been Isis	It wasn’t long after my 13th birthday that I descended into a spiral of heavy drug and alcohol abuse. It wasn’t long after the abuse began that I met Mal, aged 29. It wasn’t that I hadn’t learned my wrongs from rights, more that they didn’t matter to the group of kids I then found myself around.  &#10;&#10;Grades or sporting prowess accounted for nothing. Instead, accomplishment was measured by something that might actually be achievable: criminal records and the ability to tolerate copious amounts of drugs. Brownie points were awarded for any period of incarceration, be it in a prison cell or psychiatric facility.  &#10;&#10;Mal’s age alone was enough to earn him a significant amount of street cred in our misfit group of teenage boys, yet it was his history of extreme violence that ensured his approval rating was sky high. He was not just an incredibly violent man, but apparently belonged to a group of them. This made him even more attractive.  &#10;&#10;Mal was a member of a then-notorious neo-Nazi organisation with a track record of serious criminal activity. He regularly turned up at whatever suburban park or abandoned house we found ourselves in as we sought to consume drugs and booze away from prying eyes. I didn’t find it at all odd that a man pushing 30 was interested in hanging out with a bunch of delinquent teens. The more drunk we became, the more compelling his violent stories seemed.  &#10;&#10;One night Mal invited me to tag along to one of the group’s semi-regular gatherings. As I listened to one of the speakers rally his audience against the “foreign invaders”, I was immediately hooked. It was not I that had problems, I was told, it was people of another skin colour.  &#10;&#10;The confusion that had been my constant companion, now viewed through this extremist lens, had suddenly become both figuratively and literally black and white. No longer was I to blame for anything. I didn’t need to look at my part in my own downward spiral, as teachers, family members and police kept telling me. All life’s troubles, it seemed, were the doing of non-whites.  &#10;&#10;It was a relief to no longer feel responsible for my own – and others’ – suffering, but better than that, I was now being called upon to be a vital part of “the solution”. It is, I imagine, the same sentiment a potential jihadist feels when he or she foolishly believes that they’re being righteously called upon to fight for the creation of an Islamic state, as if that might fix what are largely personal troubles.  &#10;&#10;I became part of a group that would drive around in the leader’s ageing hatchback, plastering racist posters on walls and telegraph poles calling for action against the “Asian invasion”. Too dysfunctional to stage any coordinated sort of attack, our race war consisted of nothing more than starting fights with non-whites who were minding their own business. Since we were always heavily intoxicated, more often than not our victims survived the attacks in far better shape than we did.  &#10;&#10;Unlike today, when a disenfranchised youth has a raft of violent ideologies to be swept up in, it was then my pure fortune that my only real option for extremist activity was this poorly led group. Ongoing action by Asio and the now-defunct special branch of the NSW police and, mostly, the self-implosion of key individuals in the group, meant that by the time I joined it was only a shadow of its former strength.  &#10;&#10;Thanks to strong family support together with professional help, I was able to leave the group and its racist ideology well behind. I was eventually diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following a case of long-term bullying at school. While that has helped me understand what drove me to this group, it is clear that all the factors that leave a young person susceptible to extremist ideology – poverty, lack of education, inadequate mental health support services and general social exclusion – still widely exist across western nations.  &#10;&#10;I cringe when I hear our political leadership deliver yet another speech extolling a commitment to fighting extremism, yet in almost the time it takes to draw their next breath, go on to announce cuts to community services groups, the kind of organisations whose roles are vital in addressing the risk factors that leave one vulnerable to extremism.  &#10;&#10;It’s not that Orwell was completely off the mark when he said “people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf”. It is just that by the time the men with guns are needed, the radicalisation process has already happened.  &#10;&#10;This is a process that cannot be stopped by sending troops to regions where most locals couldn’t even spell “Australia”, let alone have the capacity or even the desire to attack us. The clear and present danger today, as events from Oklahoma City through most recently to Paris have shown, is that the biggest threats are of the home-grown variety.  &#10;&#10;The real frontline in the war on terror is to be found in our education and mental health services. Until such institutions are resourced as freely as our military is, then extremists will be here to stay.  	Radical groups recruit young people who are socially isolated, confused and angry. The way to fight their recruitment is with better social services, not better military spending

Virtually every person who takes this step ultimately throws his or her hat in the ring. It’s only a matter of time.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;How should we assess Jeb Bush’s candidacy?  &#10;&#10;Polls show him at or near the top of the prospective Republican nominees for 2016. The recent McClatchy-Marist poll has Mitt Romney and Bush leading with 19 and 15 percent respectively. And a PPP poll has Bush ahead of Chris Christie, Mike Huckabee, Paul Ryan and both Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.  &#10;&#10;Despite this, Bush by no means has an insurmountable lead. And while the Bush name for some is a positive and will help Jeb enormously, for others it is an unalterable negative both because of prior history, ideology and perceived performance in office.  &#10;&#10;That said, there is one constituency that I fully expect to support Jeb Bush: the donors, bundlers and those who pursue independent expenditure. There’s every reason to believe that this community – the money community – will rally behind Bush’s candidacy and given the importance of independent expenditure political action committees in the last presidential election, it’s fair to assume that between his own campaign committee and outsiders, he will be the best funded candidate in the Republican field.  &#10;&#10;Nevertheless, it will be far from a cakewalk for Bush in the primary. His problems are three fold.  &#10;&#10;First, his ardent support for Common Core does not sit well with many in his party. Second, he has come out in support of comprehensive immigration reform, a hot button issue today with the GOP and its supporters, especially in light of President Obama’s executive action last month. And third, he’s considered tax increases as part of an overall reform package to help balance the budget in the past – anathema to those that control the GOP today.  &#10;&#10;For all these reasons, it may be hard for Tea Party Republicans and the right wing of the party more generally, to support his candidacy.  &#10;&#10;This is not to say that Jeb Bush will not be smart enough to try to neutralize these potential disadvantages. He surely will. To this end, Bush’s thoughtful and reasonable message at the Wall Street CEOs conference was a positive and uplifting one, exactly what the Republican Party needs to go mainstream and what the Tea Party itself abhors.  &#10;&#10;Should Bush make the general election he will be a compelling candidate against the likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. The most recent poll numbers show the race between them tightening, and I suspect the campaign itself will reflect that reality.  &#10;&#10;Put another way, both Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton represent the center of their parties and both are practical politicians, if nothing else.  &#10;&#10;They’re both also smart and serious about the issues and we can expect, if they’re the nominees, to have a thoughtful debate about America’s future with the possibility of candidate agreement on a number of issues, something we haven’t seen in decades.  &#10;&#10;I know Jeb Bush and I know Hillary Clinton. They are both considerate people, committed to the broader interests of the American people regardless of political party.  &#10;&#10;Jeb Bush’s entry into the race prospectively gives the Republicans their strongest candidate and possible nominee. It also gives the American people the prospect of the best debate and dialogue we’ve had in a very long time.  &#10;&#10;Welcome, Jeb.  	Should Jeb Bush make it to the general election he will be a compelling&#10;candidate against the likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. The most&#10;recent poll numbers show the race between them tightening, and I suspect the&#10;campaign itself will reflect that reality.&#10;&#10;
138-jenesuispascharlienuancegroupt	guardian	2015-01-12T17:47:03Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/12/je-ne-suis-pas-charlie-nuance-groupthink	Roxane Gay	If je ne suis pas Charlie, am I a bad person? Nuance gets lost in groupthink	In the wake of terrorist attacks in Paris last week, many people in France and elsewhere have declared, Je suis Charlie (“I am Charlie”) after heavily armed gunmen broke into the headquarters of Charlie Hebdo, a satirical French magazine, and killed eight staff members, two police officers, a building maintenance worker and wounded several others.  &#10;&#10;On Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people including a number of world leaders such as Angela Merkel, Benjamin Netanyahu, and David Cameron gathered in Paris for a unity rally, to stand in mourning, in defiance. There were cries of Je suis Charlie, Je suis Ahmed (I am Ahmed, the Muslim police officer who lost his life in the attack), Je suis juif (I am a Jew).  &#10;&#10;These declarations were a display of solidarity with those who lost their lives and those who survived. They allowed people to try and place themselves in the lives of others by using the power of language. We have seen this kind of remembrance before in the face of tragedy: I am Troy Davis; I am Mike Brown; I am Eric Garner; I am Renisha McBride.  &#10;&#10;But we are none of these people. We can and do empathize with the plights of the dead, the survivors and their loved ones. We can and do empathize with how fragile we all are, and with how we cannot be ruled by terror, but why the rhetorical urge to take the place of the fallen? What does it bring them? I, too, have ached since hearing the news of what happened in Paris but je ne suis pas Charlie et je ne suis pas Ahmed et je ne suis pas juif.  &#10;&#10;There are times when silence equals consent, but is the loss of someone else’s life really such an instance? Is it reasonable to assume that if je ne suis pas Charlie, I tacitly endorse terrorism?  &#10;&#10;I believe in the freedom of expression, unequivocally – though, as I have written before, I wish more people would understand that freedom of expression is not freedom from consequence. I find some of the work of Charlie Hebdo distasteful, because there is a preponderance of bigotry of all kinds in many of their cartoons’ sentiments. Still, my distaste should not dictate the work the magazine produces or anything else. The cartoonists at Charlie Hebdo – and writers and artists everywhere – should be able to express themselves and challenge authority without being murdered. Murder is not an acceptable consequence for anything.  &#10;&#10;Yet it is also an exercise of freedom of expression to express offense at the way satire like Charlie Hebdo’s characterizes something you hold dear – like your faith, your personhood, your gender, your sexuality, your race or ethnicity.  &#10;&#10;Demands for solidarity can quickly turn into demands for groupthink, making it difficult to express nuance. It puts the terms of our understanding of the situation in black and white – you are either with us or against us – instead of allowing people to mourn and be angry while also being sympathetic to complexities that are being overlooked.  &#10;&#10;It has been disheartening to see calls for the Muslim community to denounce terrorism. It has been disheartening to see journalists highlighting the stories of “good” Muslims, as if goodness is the exception to the rule of an entire people.  &#10;&#10;We will continue to see discussions of satire, the freedom of expression and its limits. We will see speculations as to how such a tragedy can be avoided because it is easier to speculate than it is to accept that we cannot prevent terrorism. We cannot sway extremists with rational thought or with our ideas of right and wrong.  &#10;&#10;Life moves quickly but, sometimes, consideration does not. And yet, we insist that people provide an immediate response, or immediate agreement, a universal, immediate me-too –as though we don’t want people to pause at all, to consider what they are weighing in on. We don’t want to complicate our sorrow or outrage when it is easier to experience these emotions in their simplest, purest states.  &#10;&#10;The older (and hopefully wiser) I get, the more I want to pause. I want to take the time to think through how I feel and why I feel. I don’t want to feign expertise on matters I know nothing about for the purpose of offering someone else my immediate reaction for their consumption.  &#10;&#10;The demand for response from all of us through the means available to us, most often our social networks, rises in part because we can feel so impotent in our day-to-day lives. We are people with jobs and families and our quotidian concerns. It is easy to feel impotent in the face of terrorism in Paris or hundreds of girls being kidnapped in Nigeria or a bombing at an NAACP building in Colorado or an unarmed black man being killed by a police officer.  &#10;&#10;Within our social networks, we can feel less alone. We can feel less impotent. We can make these gestures of solidarity. Je suis Charlie. We can change our avatars. We can share our anger, our fear, or devastation without having to face that we may not be able to do much more.  &#10;&#10;But we still feel impotent and we still feel inadequate. When we see people not participating in our expressions of solidarity -- not showing their awareness of their own impotence -- we see something we can possibly change. That is why we demand allegiance.  	Roxane Gay: When our responses are limited to ‘you are either with us or against us’, those that need to mourn and be sympathetic to complexities are cast as villians

Media need to stop covering for murderous Muslims	  &#10;&#10;Every Islamic terror attack is like a grenade. The blast brutally kills and cripples its victims. Most nearby dive for cover.  &#10;&#10;That’s what the American media have been doing for decades. Every time another Muslim terrorist beheads, butchers or bombs, journalists do their best to hide from the reality. Or quickly cover up the result as if they believe the rest of us will soon forget.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Recent terror attacks in the United States, Canada, Australia and Israel (journalists love to skip them) haven’t stopped the short-term memory wipe. On Monday evening and Tuesday morning, ABC, CBS and NBC left out the Islamic connection from the trial of alleged Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.  &#10;&#10;ABC Chief Investigative Reporter Brian Ross speculated that, “the jury will also see this bullet-pocked anti-American message.” Islam? Nope.  &#10;&#10;Terrorists attacked the magazine Charlie Hebdo 24 hours later. The lions of the free press who are now supportive of the magazine. But they are the same ones who gave credence to Obama’s claims that an obscure YouTube video was the cause for a terror attack that killed a U.S. ambassador. Not the Islamic monsters who did the attack.  &#10;&#10;Remember the media reaction to the riots over Danish cartoons depicting Mohammad in 2005. Two hundred people died in global riots. Even now, the newspaper that published the cartoons must boost security.  &#10;&#10;But it wasn’t just whether to run the images. It was the rationale. The New York Times didn’t publish the cartoons, calling them “no less hurtful to most Muslims than Nazi caricatures of Jews or Ku Klux Klan caricatures of blacks are to those victims of intolerance.” “That is why the Danish cartoons will not be reproduced on these pages,” it wrote.  &#10;&#10;In the wake of the latest attack the Times used Twitter to blame the victims saying “#CharlieHebdo has long tested limits with its satire.” Financial Times associate editor Tony Barber, soon after the attack, blamed the magazine for having “a long record of mocking, baiting and needling French Muslims.” I didn’t know “needling” warranted the death penalty.  &#10;&#10;USA Today responded with the dangerous rantings of Anjem Choudary, “a radical Muslim cleric,” who also criticized the cartoonists. “Islam does not mean peace but rather means submission to the commands of Allah alone,” he admitted. Free people aren’t surprised. He added, “Muslims do not believe in the concept of freedom of expression.”  &#10;&#10;That anti-freedom argument is what news outlets are surrendering to.  &#10;&#10;But they are hardly the only cowardly media involved. Hollywood has been running scared from radical Islam for years – far worse than how it handled North Korea.  &#10;&#10;When Tom Clancy’s “Sum of All Fears” hit the big screen, the terrorists who nuke an American city were no longer dangerous Islamists as they were in the book. Evil Russians were “far more acceptable both to Hollywood sensibilities and the Arab ethnic lobby,” reported Slate. Hollywood bowed to the Muslim pressure group the Council on American-Islamic Relations.  &#10;&#10;ABC Family killed “controversial” “Alice in Arabia” rather than offend Muslims. The TV show “South Park” depicted Mohammed in a bear suit in one episode, to avoid showing an actual image. The writers still received death threats. Comedy Central killed the next episode before Islamists did the same to its staff. Two Muslim converts were convicted in the case.  &#10;&#10;A Facebook protest of the “South Park” fiasco called “Everybody Draw Mohammed Day” resulted in more threats. Artist Molly Norris ended up “moving, changing her name and essentially wiping away her identity,” according to The Seattle Weekly.  &#10;&#10;Even a Yale University Press book about the Danish cartoon controversy wouldn’t include the images that were the subject matter of the book “because the University and the Press are concerned about a possible resurgence of violence,” wrote The Yale Daily News. Then why do the book at all?  &#10;&#10;Journalists labeled those criticizing Islam “phobes,” rather than blame Muslims. Time ran a cover story asking “Is America Islamophobic?” with the preconceived answer that “hate speech against Muslims and Islam is growing both more widespread and more heated.”  &#10;&#10;It’s all part of how media and the left redefine reality. “Terrorists” become “militants” and “terrorism” becomes “workplace violence.” All to hide reality.  &#10;&#10;Until more people are slaughtered. Journalists can’t hide that many bodies.  &#10;&#10;  	Every Islamic terror attack is like a grenade. The blast brutally kills and&#10;cripples its victims. Most nearby dive for cover. That’s what the American&#10;media have been doing for decades. Every time another Muslim terrorist .

140-joandidionnewfacecelinesmart	guardian	2015-01-11T00:05:53Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/11/joan-didion-new-face-celine-smart	Rachel Cooke	Joan Didion as the new face of Céline? That’s so smart	In dark days, the heart cleaves disproportionately to Lilliputian scraps of good news and so it was that as events played out in Paris last week, I kept thinking of the writer Joan Didion, the star of Céline’s latest ad campaign, tiny in black, her porcelain face half obscured by sunglasses as big and as inky as the dinner plates in the kind of restaurants frequented by Patrick Bateman in American Psycho.  &#10;&#10;Oh, the brilliance of Didion! I like to think of myself as wholly resistant to the wicked wiles of big fashion, but this campaign seemed somehow to have got through, and I was all aflutter. What, I wondered, was the provenance of the socking great pendant that hung about her neck in Juergen Teller’s photograph? Was it by Céline or was it, as they say, model’s own? Could I find something similar on eBay? All day long, between work and news bulletins, I restlessly Googled various combinations of the words “buy”, “vintage”, “bronze”, “large” and “locket”.  &#10;&#10;The coverage of the Paris fashion house’s decision to make the author of Slouching Towards Bethlehem, The White Album and The Year of Magical Thinking its new face has focused mostly on her age. Didion is 80; when she began her career as a writer at American Vogue in the late 50s, the personnel director of the magazine’s owner, Condé Nast, would from time to time stop her in the hall and ask her when she had last called her mother.  &#10;&#10;Apparently, we should celebrate Teller’s photograph of her as a particularly exalted example of fashion’s increased willingness to embrace models with wrinkles, liver spots and histories that trail all the way back to the days when women still wore white gloves and little hats to work. At last, the thinking goes, fashion has realised that beauty may also come with silver hair. What? You don’t buy that? Well, then. Think of it this way. At least it seems finally to have grasped that women don’t simply give up shopping the moment they turn 50.  &#10;&#10;But it’s not Didion’s age that interests me. It’s her status as a writer and thinker. By choosing her – acclaimed and bestselling, but also trenchant, highly mannered and somewhat complicated – Céline’s creative director, Phoebe Philo, is sending out quite a bracing message, even if the semaphore in which it’s written will, alas, be largely illegible to those who know nothing of Didion. There’s something going on beyond the cunning commercial appeal to the kind of conflicted consumer who values the inner life as much as the outer – I mean the kind of woman whose “buttery” leather tote must be big enough to contain at least one hardback if it is not to make her feel guilty for the rest of her life.  &#10;&#10;Isn’t this campaign also in the business of suggesting that to be clever and a touch difficult (Didion is nothing if not unpredictable) is to be timelessly beautiful? That this is, in fact, a state to which women might like to aspire? Oh, Phoebe! If only I could afford your gorgeous, minimalist gear, I would dash out and buy something right now just to say thank you.  &#10;&#10;“Dress has never been a straightforward business,” wrote the novelist, Elizabeth Bowen. “So much subterranean interest and complex feeling attaches to it. As a topic, it is popular because it is dangerous – it has a flowery head but deep roots in the passions.” I think you can go too far with this: sometimes, a cardigan is just a cardigan, a clutch bag only somewhere to put your keys and bus fare home. But still, there is no doubting that mostly we use our clothes to define ourselves, to tell the world what we are, or think we are, or simply long to be. (And sometimes, too, to hide all of these things.)  &#10;&#10;I have never been into a branch of Céline, much less bought a coat or skirt there. But still, its ad campaign, for better or worse, speaks rather loudly to me. All my life, I’ve been drawn to clothes that reflect what I think I am: I favour the severe, the pared down, the un-girly – a vibe that allows for the fact that I am in some ways so deeply Protestant, I would sit on a spike all day long if I could. (Also that I am a bit of a blue stocking.)  &#10;&#10;And yet how often have I chickened out? How often do I try, even now, to wear pretty clothes, fun clothes, to embrace colour and print and embroidery? To toddle along in shoes in which I cannot run or even, if I’m honest, walk? Like most professional women who are neither beautiful nor willing to play dumb all of the time, I fear being thought ugly or uncompromising or seeming as if I have not made an effort. I fear, if you will, being seen to be picking a fight, whether by the way I speak or the way I dress. I guess you could say that I wear the swishy frock and high heels the better that I might be allowed, sometimes, to speak my mind.  &#10;&#10;I adore the way that Didion, half child and half sphinx, thinner than a cigarette, looks. But she is not, and never has been, classically beautiful. Nor is she willing to play the fool. She is discreet, but never decorous; she is fierce, preternaturally observant and, sometimes, a little self-obsessed. And her clothes – unfussy, elegant, practical, a touch forbidding – reflect this. What Teller’s photograph says to me is: approach with caution; subject may bite. I love the continuity in this, the wholeness, the confidence in the way that the clothes are an extension of the personality – and I salute Phoebe Philo for recognising it, for extolling it to the world as worthy of admiration, as a thing to be replicated by those women who have the pluck, if not exactly the hard cash.  	Rachel Cooke: Céline’s use of Joan Didion as the star of its new ad equates brains with beauty. Hurrah.
141-jobonlyhalfdoneafghanistan	aljazeera	Sat, 06 Dec 2014 08:01:04 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/job-only-half-done-afghanistan-201412661314812621.html	Jan Egeland	Our unkept promise to Afghan women	As international leaders gathered in London this week to discuss Afghanistan, we once again heard familiar proclamations of support for Afghanistan and renewed commitments towards its people, particularly women and girls. International partners promised to continue to assist Afghanistan through its "transformation decade", but also underlined that as NATO completes it military mission, they also expect the country to stand on its own feet.  &#10;&#10;This message has its merits. International donors have been generous in giving billions in foreign aid to Afghanistan. Countless lives - foreigners and Afghans - have been lost in the violence. As the military transition completes, Afghanistan is also ushering in a new government, headed by President Ashraf Ghani, who has visionary ambitions for his country, and has made firm commitments to support and empower women and girls. As a regular visitor to the war-torn country, I, too, believe that Afghans possess the ingenuity, resilience and desire to transform from poverty to prosperity.  &#10;&#10;There have been remarkable, often unacknowledged, gains in Afghanistan. For years, as the Taliban ruled, Afghanistan was the world's forgotten country. Human rights abuses were endemic and the population shrank as millions poured over the borders to Iran and Pakistan as refugees. Women were kept from schools and employment and forced into early marriages. Today, many of those refugees have returned home. Millions of girls are in school and record numbers of women are pursuing higher education. There are accomplished female political leaders, policewomen, judges, and for the first time in its young democracy, Afghanistan has a high-profile and active First Lady, Rula Ghani, championing the rights of Afghanistan's internally displaced.  &#10;&#10;Unfinished business  &#10;&#10;But as we acknowledge progress, we must also accept we have unfinished business in Afghanistan. There is no quick fix for the devastation of 40 years of war, and the Afghan people are still struggling. As foreign troops prepare to leave, my organisation, the Norwegian Refugee Council, is expanding its humanitarian programmes to assist growing numbers of internally displaced persons.  &#10;&#10;In 2014 alone, 120,000 Afghans have fled their homes and communities because of violence. These displaced Afghans, often in need of urgent assistance, typically flock to Kabul and other cities where they believe support will be available for them.  &#10;&#10;Yet, walk around the overcrowded, ramshackle dwellings, as I did late last year, and it is clear to see that their needs are not being met. On the contrary, they are growing, with women almost always suffering the most.  &#10;&#10;Afghan women I met told me how their priority is to find a safe place to live in a land still beleaguered by violence. They spoke of the enormous challenges they faced for members of their families to find jobs or earn an adequate income in a country where more than a third already live under the poverty line. Many shared with me the worries they have about being able to put food on the table for their families, a concern all the more alarming given that 1.2 million of the country's children presently suffer from malnutrition. Women without the support of male family members; those widowed, abandoned, who have escaped abuse or care for a disabled husband, are particularly vulnerable.  &#10;&#10;As there can be no quick fix for war, there is no easy solution for decades of women's rights abuses. Women are much more likely to be more disadvantaged than their husband or brother, and many face extreme poverty, physical and psychological violence, illiteracy and discrimination in all facets of life. There are still deeply entrenched social stigmas towards women working or pursuing education.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;Unaware of rights  &#10;&#10;Many Afghan women are not aware of their rights and their voices are too rarely heard. I am proud that the Norwegian Refugee Council works directly with thousands of women at a community level to educate them about their legal rights, and help them navigate systems and processes that still too often discriminate against them.  &#10;&#10;And yet, despite these needs, despite the tenuous gains in women's rights, international humanitarian support to help Afghanistan is actually declining. In 2014, the UN lowered its humanitarian appeal by 14 percent, in recognition that donors would not provide adequate funding for a larger appeal.  &#10;&#10;The US - by far the largest donor - halved its development aid in 2014. In August, the World Food Programme announced that a $40m funding shortfall meant that they were forced to cut food rations, meaning food shortages are likely to grow. We hear all too often that girls' schools are facing closure because of lack of future funding.  &#10;&#10;In many respects, the realities in Afghanistan today have been an uneasy backdrop to the London Conference. While international partners have again committed to support Afghanistan, this must be matched with donors making real, long-term contributions.  &#10;&#10;For Afghanistan to be the country of prosperity, freedom and safety we want it to be, and with full support for women's rights, international governments must produce a set of genuine commitments and pledges, including addressing the most pressing humanitarian needs. Ordinary Afghans, women in particular, must be reassured that "transformation" doesn't equate to a reduction in the world's interest or concern for their lives. We have no excuses: We know what needs to be done.  	As there can be no quick fix for war, there is no easy solution for decades of&#10;women's rights abuses.&#10;&#10;

As the original caretakers, we know what it will take to ensure these lands are available for generations to come. This pipeline will leak, it will contaminate the water. It will encourage greater tar sands development, which, in turn, will increase carbon emissions.  &#10;&#10;As Oceti Sakowin people, we cannot stand silent in the face of the potential ecological disaster that the pipeline promises our homelands, along with our brothers and sisters of the Cree and Dene First Nations in Alberta, where this carbon-intensive dirty oil comes from. Our acts of resistance to the Keystone XL pipeline are a perfect example of us wising up to the ongoing modern colonialist game, and a proactive step toward protecting future generations from the worst impacts of climate change.  &#10;&#10;As indigenous peoples, as Oceti Sakowin, we were handed down the original teachings on how to live in balance with Mother Earth. We must see all aspects of life as related, to respect the feminine principle of creation and to maintain a sustainable relationship with the land. These tenets are antithetical to the extractive economy we are faced with today. The land, air, and water are commodified. Mother Earth is being drilled, fracked, clear-cut, and destroyed with such brutality. We are on the brink of climate catastrophe. In order to avoid drastic climate change, we need a moratorium on fossil fuel development and we need to invest in a zero carbon economy: our original teachings demand no less than this.  &#10;&#10;The lack of proper consultation with tribal nations along the proposed route of the Keystone XL pipeline violates basic tenets of US Federal Indian Law and the principle of free, prior and informed consent recognized in international law. I applaud President Obama’s decision to veto any Congressional Keystone XL bill, but I also encourage him to respect indigenous people’s self- determination and our need to protect Mother Earth by rejecting the presidential permit for the KXL pipeline, too.  &#10;&#10;I urge our allies to stand with Native people, heed our call for systemic change to how we create and utilize energy and the policies that regulate both, support our right to self-determination, and join our movement to protect the territorial integrity and sacredness of Mother Earth. Reject the Keystone XL pipeline. Shut down the tar sands. Let’s put an immense collective effort forward to ensure that each of our future generations have a healthier, far more sustainable world than what we have today. For that, my relatives, would be our greatest triumph.  	Dallas Goldtooth: Indigenous people are the original caretakers of the land the pipeline would run through. But we haven’t been given a seat at the table

We have a duty to act	This year the UN marks its 70th anniversary. Sadly, there is little time for reflection or celebration. More pressing are the competing demands and challenges fuelled by an upsurge in conflict, disease and human suffering. These compel the international community to step up and provide the leadership needed to tackle them.  &#10;&#10;Ebola continues to plague west Africa. For some of the affected countries, struggling to overcome the effects of bitter civil war, the outbreak has been a major setback for development. We are beginning to see some improvements. During my visit to the region in December, I was deeply moved by the efforts of local Ebola responders and health workers from across Africa and the world. But rebuilding shattered lives and economies will require significantly more resources and long-term commitment.  &#10;&#10;As conflicts raged and extremism rose, 2014 pushed the UN’s humanitarian, peacekeeping and diplomatic efforts to the limit. More than 100 million people needed assistance. An unprecedented number of UN troops and police are deployed in highly volatile security environments.  &#10;&#10;The elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons programme was a major achievement, but the conflict continues to inflict immense suffering and will soon enter its fifth year. As bitter winter conditions set in, millions of refugees are in need of life-saving humanitarian assistance. The presence of thousands of foreign terrorist fighters there and in Iraq has added a further volatile dimension.  &#10;&#10;Groups responsible for atrocities have capitalised on a legacy of atrocious governance towards disenfranchised populations. Our response to brutality and extremism cannot be limited to military action, important as it is. We must address the conditions that give rise to such poison in the first place. In the same vein, those conducting military actions against terrorists must be sure that such efforts fully observe human rights. As we have seen time and again, failure to do so can end up serving as a recruiting agent for terrorists.  &#10;&#10;Elsewhere, the recent appalling terrorist attacks in Paris show how vulnerable any society can be. Countries in Europe and elsewhere have witnessed a deeply worrying escalation of tensions between communities and within societies. Giving in to hatred and sowing division only guarantees a spiral of violence – precisely what terrorists seek. We must not fall into that trap. Addressing discord in a manner that solves, rather than multiplies, the problem may be the greatest test our human family faces in the 21st century.  &#10;&#10;There is a long list of other hot-spots – stretching from Nigeria to Yemen, from the rise in fighting in Darfur to the transition in Afghanistan. Conflict in Ukraine has endangered security and stability in Europe, and reanimated the ghosts of the cold war. Israelis and Palestinians must ease the explosive situation in Gaza and the West Bank, and move away from confrontation and towards a negotiated settlement.  &#10;&#10;But in a year marked by turmoil, UN member states have also proposed an initial draft set of sustainable development goals that will guide anti- poverty efforts for the next generation. Further negotiations will begin this month and culminate at a special summit in New York in September with the adoption of a development agenda that can help tackle inequality, empower women and girls, and promote shared prosperity.  &#10;&#10;Climate action took on significant momentum with major announcements by the EU, the US and China, and a successful climate conference in Lima, Peru, that kept complex negotiations on track. We must aim high: for the adoption of an ambitious and universal agreement in Paris in December to keep the rise in global temperatures below the dangerous threshold of 2C.  &#10;&#10;Ours is the first generation that can end poverty, and the last that can take steps to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. In this 70th anniversary year in which we renew our commitment to the goals and principles of the UN charter, the international community must rise to the moment.  	Ban Ki-moon: After a year of global turmoil, the UN and international community must work harder than ever for a sustainable future

Beahm	Last minute Christmas shopping: Five things to avoid	FILE -- Nov. 28, 2014: A man dressed as Santa Claus greets shoppers outside the J.C. Penney store at the Glendale Galleria shopping mall in Glendale, Calif. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)  &#10;&#10;This weekend millions of Americans will take to the mall to get last-minute gifts for their loved ones. They will pour through the already-picked-over selections to try and find “the gift.” For those of you who are forced into the mall this weekend: I’m sorry. Here are five things to avoid as we enter the final shopping days before Christmas.  &#10;&#10;1\. Believe the best bargains are found if you wait until the last minute. While it’s true, retailers are starting their after-Christmas sales earlier than ever – just as the Christmas shopping season starts before you get to Thanksgiving dessert – seasoned shoppers know (1) value and (2) bargain do not mean the same thing. We all know just because something is cheap doesn’t mean it’s “a bargain” or a “value.” It’s only a bargain if it is truly something you want or need, and are able to get it at a deep discount. Often last minute shoppers don’t know what they want. For those shopping this weekend you will have to settle for what circumstances present, which in many cases will be cheap materials, but not a bargains. The value is the ratio of quality (or quantity) to price. Low quality at a low price is no value, especially when compared to high quality at a low price. Values tend go early in the holiday shopping season. Cheap stays on the shelf until it’s all that’s left. 2. Believe there is still money to spend in your budget this month. Last minute shopping, particularly for December, means buying during the back half of the month. That’s typically when most income for the month is already committed, and any incremental spending means “borrowing against the future.” It’s better to buy early – and spread the purchasing over time – so you can more easily absorb the expense. Nobody likes that “January surprise.” And for new last- minute shoppers, that surprise can be surprisingly BIG! 3. Believe you can still find “just the right gift for Uncle George.” Waiting until the last minute to shop means having to make compromises. Time and selection are your two greatest “friends” when you shop early. But for last minute shoppers they become your two greatest nightmares: you’re pressed for time and all the best colors, sizes and values, are gone. Don’t put yourself under a lot of pressure to find that perfect gift. At this stage in the game, a gift will do. 4. Believe you still need “just one more” gift. We should all take a lesson out of Santa’s playbook: 1. Make a list. 2. Check it twice. Too often last minute shopping isn’t just an indication you’ve waited to the bitter end to buy those needed gifts. It also means you’ve waited too long to plan that shopping. And when that happens you’re never quite sure if you have all the gifts you need (it seems keeping track of what you’ve bought is just as hard as planning what to buy in advance!). So you keep buying just one more gift … just to make sure you’ve covered all your bases. By the way, that’s when shoppers are especially susceptible to impulse buying. An attention-arresting display will attract last minute shoppers like honey attracts flies! 5. Believe that the shopper has the advantage. While it is true that the Saturday before Christmas is still one of the busiest shopping days of the year, the advantage has swung back in favor of the retailer. With fewer hours to shop until Santa fills his sack, the retailer has the upper hand, especially if they’ve had a strong Q4.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;For some, shopping the weekend before Christmas can bring the ultimate sense of that holiday experience. For those who enjoy shopping as a pastime, it’s one of the best times to be in the mall, but for those folks who need to fulfill a shopping list, it can be one of the worst.  &#10;&#10;The early bird still does get the worm. And the late bird gets … the opportunity to pick over the dregs with a lot of other “late birds.” With the brief time remaining before Christmas, use it to “shop for fun” not for necessity. It will truly help keep you in the Christmas spirit.  	For those of you who are forced into the mall this weekend: I’m sorry. Here&#10;are five things to avoid as we enter the final shopping days before Christmas.&#10;&#10;

Before, the situation was effectively a free flow that had resulted in Syrians, mostly refugees, amounting today to 20 percent of the population on Lebanese soil.  &#10;&#10;Imagine 12 million French in the UK today. The Lebanese government has assured international agencies that it will still permit and facilitate humanitarian cases, but the step is a telling one.  &#10;&#10;The real story behind this is the annihilation of borders from Baghdad to Beirut. ISIL is one stark and ugly manifestation of that reality but so are the refugees, a tragic event that has also affected Turkey and Jordan. This zone that once facilitated trade is now closer to scenes from Road Warrior - or the sad march of the displaced.  &#10;&#10;The disintegration of Sykes Picot has blurred nation-states as cross border allegiances fight it out on a series of fronts and through a myriad of forces from Jubhat al-Nusra, Shia militias, Peshmergas, to the Lebanese Armed forces to the now infamous ISIL.  &#10;&#10;Borders don't seem to mean much in this Middle East, if they ever did. The refugees are the terrible consequence and victims of these conflicts that plague this area.  &#10;&#10;The best response to them is not visas but a proper joint response by the Lebanese government assisted by international insititutions. The reality however is that the former is incapable, and the latter insufficiently funded to deal with such a massive influx. As a result, many refugees are living in terrible conditions.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;The other harsh reality is that the Lebanese government has said that this will not affect Syrian "visitors" to Lebanon. There are six classes of visitors in the new system and the Syrian middle class and rich are unlikley to be affected.  &#10;&#10;Walid Jumblatt stated that his country should differentiate between "refugees who are fleeing death and destruction in Syria after they lost their homes," and those who intend to be politically active, but the reality is that the poorest will be most affected.  &#10;&#10;Indeed, it's a large question mark whether Lebanon has the capacity to even implement the measure it has just taken. The Syrian presence in Lebanon is so pervasive it may well be impossible to manage the situation, except to manage some future inflow.  &#10;&#10;Furthermore, the idea of Lebanon, a country barely treading water, being able to manage such a problem is unrealistic.  &#10;&#10;Only a regional and international effort of significance can manage such a scale, and regional powers are busy carving their fiefdoms and creating the very problem rather than solving it.  &#10;&#10;The plight of the refugees is key but it is also important to perceive this event from the perspective of the host country; a small nation with very poor governance and infrastructure in the midst of regional turmoil. In a way, this is Lebanon's very small response to the erosion of Sykes Picot.  &#10;&#10;Syrians are indeed everywhere in Lebanon. In Beirut, and in every village and town one visits. Flights from Beirut to Europe are one-third to half full of Syrians. Indeed, given this massive presence and Lebanon's already poor infrastructure and socio-economic state, it is an achievement that the Syrian crisis has not led to further deterioration in the country.  &#10;&#10;The relations in Lebanon between the two peoples, despite some racism and ugly incidents, could have been far worse. Until now, Lebanese hosting of the refugees is characterised by neither generosity nor enmity, but by a passive acceptance of fate.  &#10;&#10;This is partially driven by the fact that Syrians are culturally and linguistically akin, and some sectors of the Lebanese economy, e.g. construction, remain highly dependent on Syrian workers. How this will square with the new visa rules is unknown.  &#10;&#10;More importantly, this step can be seen as part of a series of recent indirect actions that attempt to strengthen the Lebanese state, or at least make the pretense of doing so. Minister of Health Abu Faour has been on an intense and mediatic campaign to clean up the food industry in Lebanon, cracking down restaurants, slaughterhouses, and airport storage sites.  &#10;&#10;Despite complaints, this clean up, if it lasts, is a welcome step for Lebanese; it is national, potentially affects everyone positively, and is an act of government.  &#10;&#10;Second, in an echo of the Nahr el-Bared campaign, the Lebanese army is taking responsibility in the Northern Bekaa and Hermel areas against the radical groups who are effectively fighting the Syrian war on Lebanese soil. Pride in the Lebanese army is rising. There are also rumours that the Lebanese government will also take on the murderous Indie-500 speeders on Lebanse highways in the spring.  &#10;&#10;If this does occur in addition to bold step of visas for Syrians, a move that would have been unheard of when Lebanon was effectively a vassal state of Damascus, then indeed Lebanon could see the bare beginnings of emerging out of chaos through these small attempts.  &#10;&#10;The political realities in Lebanon are of course more complicated and illusory than this. Many only see in all of the above feeble attempts to deflect from the reality of a total political vaccuum.  &#10;&#10;Indeed, the Lebanese visa step is obviously not humanitarian, it is a self- interested attempt to stem the tide, put a thumb in the dyke, and avoid the emergent chaos in the Middle East.  &#10;&#10;It would be better if the Lebanese had the magnamity, or much more importantly, the capacity, to continue simply receiving all Syrians, but they are barely running their own country.  &#10;&#10;Compassion requires an orderly method and capacities in order to be effectively pursued, i.e. the Lebanese need a functioning state of their own to handle such a crisis properly.  &#10;&#10;Indeed, Lebanon has mostly escaped the wars next door not out of wisdom or discipline, or any energetic international diplomacy, but because the memories of that conflict are still vivid in the minds of Lebanese adults. No one will go to war because they remember what war costs, and because they know how little they derived from the devastation.  &#10;&#10;The result of 15 years of fighting was that the state was further weakened in favour of sectarianism, cronyism and corruption, while the Lebanese kept on doing what they do best, make money and enjoy life, living for today and certainly not tomorrow. Meanwhile, social and environmental erosion make the country less and less livable by the day.  &#10;&#10;The recent steps however, triggered by political challenges and health risks, signal some early and feeble attempts at a return of the state, or at the very least preserving the semblance of the old order, the shadow of a nation-state, amidst the dark fluidity and chaos surging from there to Kurdistan.  &#10;&#10;It took the Lebanese 40 years and external pressures to begin to think about getting their house in order, if that is indeed what is happening today.  &#10;&#10;Hopefully, it won't take their neighbours that long to start to address the necessary basics of life.  	The real story behind Lebanon's new visa restrictions on Syrians is the&#10;breakdown of borders from Baghdad to Beirut.&#10;&#10;

Taylor	Can you stop using these three labels in 2015: 'Poor people,' 'date rape' and 'victim' 	Oct. 6, 2012: Don Matyja, a homeless Army veteran poses for a picture with his dog Tyson at Lions park in Costa Mesa, Calif. (AP)  &#10;&#10;FILE - Nov. 14, 2013: Susan St. Amour, 54, a homeless woman, panhandles during the evening commute in Portland, Maine. (AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty)  &#10;&#10;Can you banish the labels “date rape,” “victims” and “poor people" from your vocabulary in 2015? Labels can diminish and demean or to uplift and affirm people. 2015 will be a year of hope and dignity by redefining or banishing these toxic and harmful labels. In their place a more generous, positive and compassionate country will emerge.  &#10;&#10;Here\'s why a deeper look at these three labels:  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Date Rape. This is the most commonly talked about fear on college campuses across the country. 2014 was filled with stories of sexual abuse from the ranks of the NFL and their spouses to the iconic Bill Cosby.  &#10;&#10;On college campuses date rape involves issues of consent and sobriety; of women who feel that they don’t have the ability to consent or not; of alcohol and drugs like "roofies" used as excuses and no specific profile of the typical rapist.  &#10;&#10;The words date and rape should never be accepted as co-joined words.  &#10;&#10;My friend Tony Porter of A Call to Men says that gender based violence will only end when men address it and reassess what it means to be a man.  &#10;&#10;He is correct. To be on a date is to enter into an exploration of romance, companionship and possibly love. It is about exploring the possibilities of human togetherness and relationship. Rape is a criminal and violent exercise of abuse and power.  &#10;&#10;To disassociate these two words – rape and date – is to redefine the expectation of healthy and also criminal behavior. You can redefine the term date rape by celebrating the possibilities of healthy dating and mincing no words about the criminality of rape. Engaging young men in the cause of stopping gender based violence will bring with it lasting impact on healthy relationships.  &#10;&#10;Victims. The accusers of sexual violence are commonly called victims. They are typically the victims of aggressive non-consensual sex. But to call them victims is to deny their courage and strength. The supermodel Janice Dickinson recently said that she is not an accuser. She explained this by saying that she is speaking her truth about what Bill Cosby did to her decades ago.  &#10;&#10;How strong do you have to be to speak out against those who are iconic figures or heroes – whether clergy, Cosby or NFL players?  &#10;&#10;To speak your truth against power typically results from years if not decades of inner work along with courage that reveals you have come to love yourself enough to not be intimidated by the powerful iconic figures who have committed sexual abuse.  &#10;&#10;People like Dickinson are empowered, courageous victims. They give hope to others including the many men who feel that their manhood will be compromised if they speak out against their male sexual abusers.  &#10;&#10;Empowered victims like Dickinson move us quickly from just feeling sorry to feeling admiration for their courageous empowerment. What happened to them is criminal and to label them as just victims demeans their courage. Empowered victims elevate their status and shine a bright spotlight on their heinous sexual aggressor.  &#10;&#10;Poor People. A pervasive new classism in the United States has emerged according to columnist David Brooks of the New York Times. He posits that the meritocratic class view themselves as the respectable ones who have the ability to choose their own destiny. They view the poor as lazy, disorganized, violent and scary.  &#10;&#10;In this view the poor are not proper human beings. It’s a dangerous construct that dehumanizes vast segments of our community.  &#10;&#10;I’ve spent a lifetime working with and knowing people who are poor. Most work hard and often at several jobs; like other human beings they yearn for the best for their children and families and have aspirations to live beyond poverty.  &#10;&#10;If the organization of the lives of those who are poor is different from that of the meritocratic class it is because of genetic roulette and the systems that often work to trap people in the mire of less opportunity.  &#10;&#10;Brooks suggests that those who label the poor in this way live in a world that keeps them from knowing poor people. The label begins to be redefined when you take time to know those who are different from you.  &#10;&#10;It is up to you to make change in the New Year by not accepting these labels and then redefining them. You will be part of creating a more compassionate, generous and positive landscape.  	Can you banish the labels “date rape,” “victims” and “poor people" from your&#10;vocabulary in 2015?&#10;&#10;

The ceremony evokes mixed feelings amongst Iraqis: after all, the parade marches under massive crossed swords wielded by giant bronze hands modelled on those of Saddam Hussein himself.  &#10;&#10;For the Kurds it is an ominous ritual, a leftover from an era when Baghdad's military power far outstripped that of the Kurds and when Iraqi state power was used ruthlessly against northern rebellions. The stronger the Iraqi army gets, the Kurds reckon, the more chance it will be used against Kurdistan again.  &#10;&#10;Iraq's Sunnis were the leading force within the Iraqi army since its foundation on January 6, 1921. In general, the Sunnis fondly remember the pre-2003 army as a national institution of unrivalled prestige but view today's Iraqi army as a weak shadow of its former self, dominated by Shia officers.  &#10;&#10;The views of Iraq's Shia community may be more complex. Before 2003, the Iraqi military was regularly used as a tool of oppression against the Iraqi Shia, yet many older Shia also remember the army as a symbol of modernity and Arab nationalist pride. With a Shia-led government in Baghdad, young Shia were beginning to recognise the army as a friendly institution.  &#10;&#10;The collapse of Iraqi army divisions in northern and western Iraq in June 2014 dented the army's reputation, with recent victories being credited to the predominately-Shia popular mobilisation militias (al-Hashd al-Shaabi) or else the tiny cadre of special forces - the so-called Golden Division.  &#10;&#10;This is a critical year for the Iraqi army, which is in danger of losing its status as the nation's premier armed force.  &#10;&#10;In 2009, when the US-led "train and equip" effort reached its zenith, the Iraqi army fielded 55 combat brigades with approximately 210,000 troops. The Iraqi Ministry of Interior (MoI) fielded around 30 smaller brigades, totaling around 120,000 troops.  &#10;&#10;Today the Iraqi army fields 40 weak brigades with a total combat strength of around 48,000 troops. In contrast, the MoI survived the summer comparatively well and now fields 24 brigades, totaling around 36,000 troops. The gap has narrowed between the two security ministries.  &#10;&#10;In addition to the army and MoI, there are two other security forces that are on the rise. One is the Popular Mobilisation forces, which seem to field approximately 100,000 troops, including a well-trained offensive cadre of around 20,000 fighters.  &#10;&#10;The final potential force is the National Guard that is being considered as an option by Iraqi politicians. This force would, in theory, be trained, equipped and paid by the federal government, whilst being recruited and operated by the provincial councils.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;In a step towards this concept, a 5,000-strong US-equipped Tribal Security Force brigade has been provided with $13.5 million worth of US weapons and training in the new US Department of Defense budget.  &#10;&#10;It is now up to Iraq's government whether the country will pay these troops as part of the first National Guard units in the forthcoming 2015 budget.  &#10;&#10;It is also unclear exactly which ministry would administer the training, equipping and paying of National Guard troops: the US-backed Ministry of Defense (MoD) under Minister Khalid al-Ubeidi, a Sunni from Mosul, or the MoI, led by Badr leader Mohammed Ghabban, a close lieutenant of Badr leader Hadi al-Amiri.  &#10;&#10;The scheme could become a way of permanently employing the Popular Mobilisation forces in the National Guard units of the predominately-Shia southern provinces.  &#10;&#10;With the Kurdish Peshmerga representing another large force of around 54 brigades with 113,000 troops, the Iraqi army is thus on-track to become one of the smaller security forces in Iraq.  &#10;&#10;In 2015, the army's performance and the international support provided to Iraq's MoD will be critical factors in determining the future of this proud institution.  &#10;&#10;In the background, the slow process of rebuilding the army has already begun. New half-manned brigades are popping up at training bases in Nasiriya, Kirkush and at the collection points for the shattered army divisions across north- central Iraq. More units will follow in the coming months.  &#10;&#10;Meanwhile a US-funded $1.6 billion train and equip programme will aim to produce a further nine full-strength Iraqi army brigades in 2015, adding a further 45,000 troops to the army and nearly doubling its frontline combat strength. (Three Peshmerga brigades or 15,000 troops will also be re-equipped under the programme).  &#10;&#10;The first of 250 US-provided Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles have arrived in Iraq, sent directly by the United States at no cost from Afghanistan. Another 3,496 tactical vehicles (Hummers, trucks, fuel tankers and engineering vehicles) will also be provided to the Iraqi army cost-free by the US military, and Iraq will probably buy a further 1,000 newly-built M1151A1 up-armoured Hummers in 2015.  &#10;&#10;If the US follows through on its pledges of training and equipment, the Iraqi army could survive its disastrous year in 2014 and play a key role in the struggle to evict Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) forces from cities like Mosul, Tikrit, Ramadi and Fallujah.  &#10;&#10;The Iraqi army can draw on some illustrious history.  &#10;&#10;In 1973, it deployed 18,000 troops with 300 tanks to save Damascus during the "October War": this feat, mustering and moving an army 1,200km in just six days, remains deeply impressive.  &#10;&#10;Iraq's five lightning offensives in April, May and June of 1988 shattered the Iranian army and were textbook examples of planning and execution.  &#10;&#10;If the Iraqi army can be rebuilt with Shia, Sunni Arab and Kurdish political support, and if the well-led Ministry of Defense can guide the National Guard initiative, the coming year could witness new Iraqi army victories at Mosul.  &#10;&#10;Successful operations undertaken by this national institution, with deep roots in the Iraq's history, will be far more beneficial to the country than victories scored solely by Shia militias or local Sunni uprisings, either of which could further fracture Iraq.  	If the Iraqi Army can be properly rebuilt, there's hope for a pluralistic and&#10;stable Iraq.&#10;&#10;

In the 18th century, Russian meddling in Crimea and Syria would have likely led to war with Turkey. Today, Russia's actions in the former Ottoman world mean a state visit for Russian President Vladimir Putin, discounted natural gas, and lucrative trade deals. Turkey's recent coziness with Russia, and its reluctance to take on the ISIL, have left many politicians in the West confused and frustrated. However, to understand Turkish foreign policy one must first look at US and European foreign policy.  &#10;&#10;The lack of any coherent US-Middle East policy has made Turkey reluctant to respond to ISIL in any meaningful way. US President Barack Obama's disinterest in the region began with his hell-bent desire to remove all US forces from Iraq, no matter what the security situation was like. As far as Ankara was concerned, the US left behind unfinished business in Iraq.  &#10;&#10;Next came the US response to the so-called Arab Spring, which amounted to telling regional autocrats that they had to go, and when they did not leave, the US failed to do anything about it.  &#10;&#10;Perhaps the biggest failure of Obama's Middle East policy was drawing a "red line", and then failing to enforce it when Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons against his own people.  &#10;&#10;Pushing Turkey away  &#10;&#10;Since Turkey does not believe the US will see through to the completion of its mission to take on ISIL and force Assad out of power, understandably, Ankara has been reluctant to come on board. As far as Ankara is concerned, US creditability in the Middle East is bankrupt.  &#10;&#10;It is not just US foreign policy pushing Turkey away from the West. This week, the EU's new foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, visited Ankara and told a group of journalists that the EU's "top priority will be Turkey's EU accession process". After years of delays by Brussels, it is not likely anyone in Turkey will believe these words - nor should they. Europe's empty promises of EU membership, and its weak response over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has forced Turkey to hedge its bets that closer ties with Moscow are preferable to those with Brussels. Making a bad situation worse is the degree of European xenophobia lurking inside the debate around Turkish membership of the EU.  &#10;&#10;Make no mistake; Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has not been the easiest leader for the West to work with. Apart from some of his more ridiculous, but harmless statements - "Muslim sailors reached the American continent 314 years before Columbus, in 1178" - many in the West have been put off by his crackdown on political dissent, limitations on press freedom, and his drive to bring a more conservative brand of Islam into what is still a largely secular society.  &#10;&#10;Leaders in the West would be wise not to dismiss Turkey altogether because of Erdogan's ironfisted leadership style. Turkey is a parliamentary democracy, but as the president, Erdogan derives his extensive powers because his Justice and Development Party (AKP) currently controls parliament. Without an AKP majority in parliament, the centre of power in Turkish politics is likely to shift back to the prime minister's office.  &#10;&#10;In June, Turkey will hold its next parliamentary elections - and if the elections are anything like Turkey's 2014 presidential elections, the race will be close. If the AKP does not get a majority, or if they have to form a coalition, Erdogan's power and influence will be significantly curtailed.  &#10;&#10;Turkey is situated in a dangerous neighbourhood. It has land borders with Syria, Iraq, and Iran. Its border with Armenia is closed. A recent investigation uncovered a terror organisation operating inside Turkey with links to Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. ISIL controls huge swaths of land along the Turkish border with Syria and Iran. The threat from Assad is so great that NATO currently provides air defence units to protect Turkish airspace. It is clear that foreign policy decisions taken by the US and Europe have left Turkey feeling exposed.  &#10;&#10;Short-sighted leaders in the West need to open their eyes and see Turkey for what it really is: a valued NATO partner, a secular state (at least for now) bridging Europe and the Islamic world, a developing economy and a major player in the energy market. What a tragedy it would be if broken promises from Europe, combined with a lack of US leadership and strategy in the Middle East, results in a Turkey that becomes more fundamentalist, anti-western, and pro- Russian.  	Leaders in the West would be wise not to dismiss Turkey altogether because of&#10;Erdogan's ironfisted leadership style.&#10;&#10;

Levy	Let’s recruit academically gifted students from poor neighborhoods the same way we seek out star athletes	FILE -- English teacher Tom Rademacher talks with his high school juniors Kierra Murray, left, and Ana Silverman, right, at Fair School in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/Jim Mone)  &#10;&#10;A recent report , according to Reuters, finds that “more than 3,000 students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill received credit for fake classes over an 18-year period as part of a program that allowed many of them to remain eligible to play sports.”  &#10;&#10;But college sports scandals, like the one at North Carolina, are missing the point. We should not be focusing on how the university broke the rules of college sports for almost 20 years by sending thousands of athletes to no-show classes to keep players eligible for play.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;We should not even be asking whether the University of South Carolina and several other NCAA schools should guarantee four-year, “full cost of attendance” scholarships. The real question is far more basic: Why do so many colleges treat their star athletes better than their star students?  &#10;&#10;The comparison between how colleges treat athletes and high performing, low- income students is particularly revealing. Student athletes are sought out; once identified they are actively recruited; admission comes with generous scholarships and once admitted students are pampered with better housing, free or subsidized food and special college counseling to help them adjust to college life.  &#10;&#10;High performing, low-income students, in contrast, take out loans, engage in work-study programs and, once admitted, are left largely to fend for themselves.  &#10;&#10;We simply aren’t doing enough to help academically gifted students who have financial need to offset the challenges of attending college. First generation college goers, attending schools far away from home and family, are often quite fragile.  &#10;&#10;As a result, the smart-but-poor struggle. Only 59% of children from low-income households scoring in the top quartile on standardized tests go on to graduate from a 4-year college, while 77% of children with similar scores but from wealthy families earn bachelor’s degrees. Worse, fully 17% of the top quartile of poor kids do not even apply to college. Recruited Tar Heel athletes have it far easier.  &#10;&#10;Many factors contribute to this disparity, but one of the most significant obstacles preventing high-achieving, low-income students from attaining their full potential is they exist in isolation in high school. They do their part in school but are held back because they aren’t identified and given support and guidance they need. There is no football coach or athletic counselor for these kids; they are on their own to develop a college selection strategy, navigate the maze of loan forms and develop a college budget.  &#10;&#10;Ironically, the way big-time college athletes are recruited offers solutions to address this problem.  &#10;&#10;We should seek out talented students from poor backgrounds the way athletics coaches search for high school athletes. Coaches know part of their job is to find and cultivate talent, so they send scouts to take in countless high school games looking for the next Tom Brady.  &#10;&#10;Admissions counselors often visit schools in wealthy suburbs, where most of the best students are college-bound anyway. How often do they visit schools in impoverished areas looking for the next Sonia Sotomayor? What if colleges had academic scouts to scour science fairs, mathematics competitions, art shows, and school plays seeking out the super smart, highly-diligent, poor kid?  &#10;&#10;Star athletes are also celebrated by their local media and ranked in nationwide publications. They go from small-town heroes to catching the attention of the best athletic programs in the country. There is nothing comparable for the smart kid. We are a long way from the revenge of the nerds.  &#10;&#10;Half the high schools in this country don’t even have college counselors; where they do exist, the quality provided is often abysmal—either because the counselors have enormous caseloads or lack the resources and experience. For example, when I was Schools Chancellor, one New York high school had a single college counselor for 2,000 students.  &#10;&#10;Coaches also recruit by inviting potential applicants to make “official visits” paid for by the college, which can include transportation, daily meals, a room to stay in during visits, even entertainment expenses. For many low-income, academically-gifted students, a paid college visit, especially one catered to their academic interests, is completely out of reach. Until the recent initiative led by Bloomberg Philanthropies and the College Board, the application fee itself was a barrier.  &#10;&#10;Do we really want to tell students that catching balls is more important than acing tests?  &#10;&#10;Consider NFL Hall of Famer Jerry Rice, for years an undiscovered talent. He excelled but failed to gain attention from the best football programs like Ohio State or Oklahoma. So he attended Mississippi Valley State University, where he was finally recognized and went on to have one of the best football careers of all time.  &#10;&#10;What if he had never picked up a ball? And what if today we fail to recognize academic talent in poor neighborhoods, never developing the whiz kids?  &#10;&#10;What if Albert Einstein had become an accountant or Neal DeGrasse Tyson a telephone repairman?  &#10;&#10;We do not need to end sports scholarships to address this issue, we just need to level the playing field. By placing athletics ahead of academics, however, many colleges are making profoundly poor choices. The cost to our society of unrealized academic potential is unfathomable.  &#10;&#10;My organization was founded by a legendary sportsman, Jack Kent Cooke, who knew there was too much untapped potential in the nation’s young people. He left the bulk of a fortune from owning the Redskins to start the largest academic scholarship foundation in America— to find low-income, exceptional students who beat the odds.  &#10;&#10;A fortune built on sports is dedicated to promoting academic stars. The NCAA could learn something.  	Why do so many colleges treat their star athletes better than their star&#10;students? We simply aren’t doing enough to help academically gifted students&#10;who have financial need to offset the challenges of attending college.&#10;&#10;
150-littlehopewasarsonwhymademovie	foxnews	2014-12-09T12:00:03Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/12/09/little-hope-was-arson-why-made-movie-about-burning-churches/	Theo Love	'Little Hope Was Arson': Why I made a movie about burning churches	First Church of Christ, Scientist in Tyler, Texas burns to the ground in "Little Hope Was Arson" the documentary about solving an East Texas mystery in theaters and online now. (Jamie Waldonado)  &#10;&#10;As the son of missionaries, losing my faith was no small event. I was 19 and hurting. My older brother was strung out on a number of drugs and I had moved in with him naively attempting to help my childhood hero.  &#10;&#10;One night he jumped on top of me, wrapped both hands around my throat and had all the rage in his eyes needed to end my life. When he saw that I wasn’t struggling, he let go, only to wake the next morning and drag me to church.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;My brother could threaten my life on Saturday night and, come Sunday morning, lift his hands to Jesus. That morning in his church I lost hope in the transformation that supposedly comes with faith.  &#10;&#10;On Christmas Day I announced to my father that I no longer wanted to be a Christian.  &#10;&#10;A few months later, I boarded a ship in New Zealand operated by the medical missions branch of YWAM—Youth with a Mission—though I was hardly signing up for six months to serve God. I was there to prove that God didn’t exist.  &#10;&#10;One afternoon David Cowie, the head of the program, asked how I was doing and I spilled my guts. At that point every kid who’s grown up in a church knows the drill: I disclose my doubt; he gives the come-back-to-Jesus speech; roll credits.  &#10;&#10;But I reached the end of my story and David said nothing. He sat in silence. Not the kind of silence that communicates indifference, but the kind that is reserved for close friends sharing a moment of understanding. He didn’t push me away or try to rush my journey with God.  &#10;&#10;The next few months were transformational, a religious love story. Like many in my generation, the faith I’d lost inside the four walls of a church was found again through believers who left the sanctuary to help people in need. I hadn’t been persuaded by a man building a congregation; I was undone by a friend who listened without judgment.  &#10;&#10;These were the thoughts rattling around in my head when I heard the story of 10 churches in East Texas that had burned to the ground. Right away I could see the makings of a great crime documentary akin to Errol Morris’ "The Thin Blue Line," but on a personal level, I also saw a road into my questions about churches.  &#10;&#10;Ironically it was my brother who encouraged me to start making the film. With his help I scraped together enough cash to cover airfare to Texas and a small camera crew.  &#10;&#10;Then came a few more surprises. As I interviewed pastors mourning the loss of their churches, I felt a growing sense of sympathy. Far more than buildings, these people had lost their community homes -- places that heard wedding vows recited and last goodbyes whispered at funerals. I began to feel sheepishly aware of my own cultural insensitivity. After all, this was, as many locals put it, “The buckle of the Bible belt.”  &#10;&#10;But the more I learned about the two young men who deliberately torched 10 houses of worship, the more I saw of myself. Jason Bourque and Daniel McAllister had grown up attending Sunday school together. When family problems and tragedy struck, their faith in God stumbled and they left the church. But during their time of need, no one was there to listen as there had been for me.  &#10;&#10;"Little Hope Was Arson" ends with a quote from the Spanish anarchist Buenaventura Durruti: “The only church that illuminates is a burning church.”  &#10;&#10;When a church burns does it simply illuminate the night, or through its destruction will the world see the Gospel shine?  &#10;&#10;  	When a church burns does it simply illuminate the night, or through its&#10;destruction will the world see the gospel shine?&#10;&#10;

Particularly when said storms feature figures who like to think of themselves as controversial and as deliberately baiting us: Rihanna posing in a clingy burqa at a mosque, Mario Balotelli posting a racist image, and now Madonna doctoring pictures of African and African-American leaders to promote her new album.  &#10;&#10;Really, the only dignified thing to do is to not dignify it with a response, and move on. Who cares if Madonna straps black ropes on the images of dead black rights icons? As Peter Robinson wrote in the Guardian: “It’s slightly heartbreaking that Madonna, an artist who made her name through an intuitive grasp of almost every major trend and zeitgeist fluctuation, is so crap at social media.”  &#10;&#10;But sometimes a solely jaded response betrays our own complacency, like resigning yourself to the fact that there will always be people who think of racist slurs as banter, or those who think it is just fine to appropriate the symbols of others to give their own tepid existence some edge, or people who still wear bootcut jeans. It’s not OK, no matter how persistent and ever- present it is.  &#10;&#10;Even though Madonna has always been controversial, it also seems that as the world around her has got sharper, she has got duller and more derivative. The appropriation that she and others have carried out is nothing new; we’re just noticing it more. That’s because those who are piggybacking on others’ journeys do not only have more channels to flaunt their cluelessness and sense of entitlement (Iggy Azalea, walk away from Twitter) but they are also being called out on it more. Whether it is usurping religion – crucifixes and nun habits are passe now; it’s niqabs on naked bodies – keep up – homosexuality or now minority rights, Madonna is a manifestation of how privilege feeds off the authenticity of “struggle”. This is a double plundering that leads to further marginalisation: the dominant narrative will oppress you, then co-opt you, and then weave you into your own tiny little section of the tapestry.  &#10;&#10;Some would argue that slavery and segregation ended long ago (well, segregation in the US in the 60s and apartheid in South African in the 90s, so not that long ago). But that doesn’t mean white people can now happily vandalise the cultural and historical totems of a minority’s struggle as part of some universal poster for the white western narrative of overcoming and learning from our mistakes. Imagine a pop artist using the recent CIA torture as part of their campaign – perhaps showing dead Arab personalities being waterboarded. No? Too soon? Well, when it comes to certain issues, it will always too soon.  &#10;&#10;Of course, the charitable position is that Madonna, or to a different extent, Iggy Azalea, are not doing this with any high degree of self-awareness or design – they might see all contemporary culture as equal-access human heritage that they can dip into and sample as a vehicle for their talent.  &#10;&#10;They would be right to some extent, but the sad fact is that these modern iterations of minority culture that they are sampling all arose from suffering and oppression rather than from a series of tortured geniuses in drawing rooms across Europe. Yes, there are spaces where our common mix of religious, sexual and racial legacies intermingle – gloriously, sometimes. But that is usually an uncurated, spontaneous thing, not a cynical shopping list.  &#10;&#10;To put it simply, edginess comes from just that: being on the edge. Ironically, all Madonna and her ilk’s desperate antics to appear so only confirm that they are, in fact, utterly comfortable and mainstream. Cultural appropriation is now the standard default of the unoriginal. It is a common and predictable template, where one becomes a cliche in trying to avoid being a cliche because you have nothing new to offer – something Madonna would surely be mortified by.  	Nesrine Malik: As they plunder minority cultures in their desperation to appear edgy, all artists such as Iggy Azalea and Madonna succeed in doing is flaunting their unoriginality

Even political obsessives quail at the thought. So I plead guilty to bringing a little genuine political debate into the process so early on in the process. The issue is the new Scottish Labour leader, Jim Murphy, and his vainglorious boast that he is going to use mansion tax money from London and the south -east to pay for 1,000 new nurses in Scotland.  &#10;&#10;Let me stress that I support the mansion tax in principle. It is a redistributive tax, which is important, and taxes on assets are always worth considering.  &#10;&#10;The complication is that it is, in effect, a tax on London, 80% of which will be paid by people in London and the south -east. And the distorted nature of London’s housing market could mean a tax with wildly distorted effects. No one really knows how much it will raise. It seems likely that the people everyone agrees should pay it – the international super-wealthy – will use their expensive lawyers and accountants to evade it.  &#10;&#10;But it will hit older Londoners, often public sector workers who bought houses in what were then unfashionable parts of London, as in my constituency, Hackney North and Stoke Newington. Now they are living in houses worth £1m and rising. They are often asset rich but cash poor. Having seen London house prices spiral in value, they are not reassured by the idea that the mansion tax kicks in only at £2m. At the very least, a lot of work needs to be put in to reassure those voters, and to fashion a tax that will not hit those people unfairly. Fortunately the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, has an open mind on the subject.  &#10;&#10;That is why it is surprising that Murphy has jumped in feet first, boasting about how he will spend money from a tax when there is no agreement on exactly how it will be levied.  &#10;&#10;I am a unionist, and I understand that the Labour party has a big electoral challenge in Scotland. But I cannot believe that Scottish voters will be taken in by a crude attempt to buy their votes with money expropriated from London. If Murphy is really interested in redistributing wealth, why isn’t he talking about council tax revaluation or levels of income tax in Scotland? Instead he seeks cheap applause by telling the Scots how he will extract money from England.  &#10;&#10;Recently there has been a series of reports, including from the London Finance Commission and the Royal Society of Arts City Growth Commission, calling for the devolution of powers to our great cities. In particular, experts are saying that big cities should be allowed to keep their property taxes – I believe that this process should start with the mansion tax.  &#10;&#10;Devolution cannot be for Scotland alone; there should also be devolution of powers to the cities and regions. Murphy cannot bully the rest of the UK about a considered devolution of fiscal powers to all our cities with a pre-emptive strike on the mansion tax.  &#10;&#10;It is too easy to conflate London with bankers and the international glitterati. But London is more unequal than any other part of Britain. Child poverty is a third higher in London than the rest of England as a whole. So, general election campaign or not, we need a proper debate on devolution of powers to our great cities. It is part of the battle against the poverty that still exists in the shadow of the glittering towers of the City of London. And some people need to be prepared to stand up for London in this important debate.  	Diane Abbott: Instead of electioneering from Scotland’s Labour leader, we need a proper debate on devolution of powers to our great cities

I remember a time not so long ago when a marathon runner was a mythical beast – we all knew someone who knew someone who had run a marathon, but most of us had only ever seen these creatures on the TV in their emaciated, long-limbed flow. But now everyone knows a marathon runner and they just look like normal people.  &#10;&#10;Somewhere along the way, marathons became commonplace and a whole new breed of extreme activities came along – the Ironman triathlon; multi-day cycle events like John O’Groats to Lands End; crazy ultra marathons like the Thames Path 100; and events that defy description like the Tough Mudder. While a lot of extreme challenges are to do with ultra endurance, the Tough Mudder is short but involves getting hurt. Sometimes by electric shocks. And fire. What is wrong with you, Mudders?  &#10;&#10;I have no idea what caused the rise of the extreme sports as a phenomenon, but I do know what happened for me. After many years of corporate life and general indolence I found myself resting a glass of champagne on a large belly, unable to get to the buffet without puffing. Horrified at the realisation that I had become Mr Creosote from The Meaning of Life, I resolved immediately to sign up for the Great Edinburgh Run. The GER was only 10k but it terrified me and filled me with doubts: what if I came last? Do I have to run all the way? Will I be the fattest dude on the course? Four months later I completed it easily. And then I signed up for a marathon. And then an Ironman.  &#10;&#10;And this is the thing – every step of the way you reassess your judgment of what is crazy. It becomes a rapidly escalating obsession. What seemed like a hardcore event reserved solely for proper endurance loons soon becomes just within reach. Six years after the GER, the only event I still consider to be bonkers beyond belief is the Marathon des Sables. And that’s only because everyone knows that Scots melt in the desert.  &#10;&#10;My personal theory for the rise of the extreme sports is that life has become sterile. The chances of really getting an adrenaline rush in day-to-day life is minimal, so people search out ways to re-engage with life. After completing two Ironman events, I can testify that the feeling of sweeping down the finish chute after 140.6 miles to pumping pop music, flashing lights and a cheering crowd is the ultimate buzz. But finishing a marathon, in an empty car park, in the dark, in the pouring rain, is easily its equal for an overwhelming inner sense of achievement.  &#10;&#10;The other personal joy I get from training for events is the quiet time. Although modern life is humdrum, it is noisy, and even a three-mile run gives me the chance to clear my head, breathe cold fresh air and feel the wind on my skin. Within 10 minutes of beginning a run my head is clear, I am calm and I am reset.  &#10;&#10;The side benefit of all this training (and probably the reason that most people start ) is health. If you run, cycle or swim you lose weight and feel more vital for it. You are fitter, stronger and sleep more soundly. You are fit for life – the kid climbing on your shoulders, the run for the bus, even just climbing the stairs become infinitely more manageable. It also sets a great example – my three-year-old has now collected finisher’s medals at Ironkids and Loch Ness Marathon and loves being outside because that’s what mummy and daddy do.  &#10;&#10;The increase in demand cannot be satisfied. A new event seems to spring up every day. No longer restricted by a single Ironman distance you can do double, triple or even (for the proper enthusiasts) deca Ironman. You can run the 268 frostbitten, British-winter miles of the Spine Race. You can even get teargassed in the Tough Mudder. Whether for the T-shirt, the tattoo or just the sheer pride of accomplishment, extreme sports are here to stay.  	Dougie Cameron: Once you’ve conquered your first 26 miles, it’s all about the buzz of the 140-plus miles of an Ironman, or even getting teargassed for fun at a Tough Mudder

He was a model of progressivism and a gifted rhetorician.  &#10;&#10;In most media accounts, references were made to two speeches Cuomo delivered in 1984, one at the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco where Walter Mondale was nominated for president, and the other at the University of Notre Dame where Cuomo spoke about abortion and the "proper" role of religion in politics.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;The thing about progressivism is that it resembles floor wax -- all shine and no depth.  &#10;&#10;In his Democratic convention speech, Cuomo referenced Ronald Reagan\'s line about America being a "shining city on a hill." Cuomo responded, "A shining city is perhaps all the president sees from the portico of the White House or the veranda of his ranch, where everyone seems to be doing well. But there\'s another city; there\'s another part to the shining city. ... In this part of the city, there are more poor than ever. More families in trouble. More and more people who need help but can\'t find it. ... There are people who sleep in the city streets, in the gutter where the glitter doesn\'t show."  &#10;&#10;This is boilerplate Democratic rhetoric we\'ve heard since the days of Franklin Roosevelt. After Democrats Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy, Johnson, Carter, Clinton and Obama, are fewer families in trouble? Are there fewer poor people, especially since Johnson\'s "War on Poverty" promised to end it?  &#10;&#10;Statistics reveal there are not, so why do so many embrace progressive ideas? If something isn\'t working, why repeat the errors?  &#10;&#10;As Reagan noted, government too often adds to problems; it doesn\'t solve them. Government doesn\'t create jobs; a thriving private economy does. Government welfare mostly doesn\'t incentivize people to escape poverty, but too often sustains them in poverty and addicts them to government handouts.  &#10;&#10;On the issue of church and state, Cuomo bisected the subjects in his Notre Dame speech. While he said he accepted Catholic teaching against capital punishment, he rejected its opposition to abortion. In this, the late Cardinal Joseph Bernardin expressed opposition to both issues while eloquently arguing that the Catholic Church believes that each is part of a "seamless garment" of life and that all life matters and should not be taken by individuals, or the state.  &#10;&#10;This is another flaw of progressivism. Progressives are happy to embrace church teachings when it favors their political agenda, but reject them when those teachings don\'t conform to their politics.  &#10;&#10;My one encounter with Cuomo came after a column I wrote following his 2007 debate with former Speaker Newt Gingrich at Cooper Union in New York, the site of a famous speech by Abraham Lincoln. I said that Gingrich clearly won the debate and made a mockery of Cuomo\'s liberalism.  &#10;&#10;Cuomo called me and after identifying himself launched into a tirade that lasted about 90 seconds. He then hung up giving me no opportunity to say much more than "hello, nice to hear from you."  &#10;&#10;Vanity. Vanity.  &#10;&#10;Most obituaries and news reports called Cuomo "inspiring." A New York Times editorial correctly noted: "For all his idealism, Mr. Cuomo\'s years as governor were dogged by economic recession that blunted his hopes to leave great programs and innovation as his legacy. He had to cut services and scratch for scarce revenue."  &#10;&#10;Inspiration is good if it motivates people to do for themselves and improve their lives. Otherwise, it\'s nothing more than floor wax.  &#10;&#10;May Gov. Cuomo rest in peace.  	May former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo rest in peace.&#10;&#10;

Israel has made the cut despite fervently denying possession of a nuclear arsenal.  &#10;&#10;The spectacle is unfolding at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the main judicial organ of the United Nations. A recent New York Times article on the Marshall Islands' "near-Quixotic venture" quotes Phon van den Biesen, head of the country's legal team, on the ultimate aim of the effort: "All the nuclear weapons states are modernising their arsenals instead of negotiating [to disarm], and we want the court to rule on this."  &#10;&#10;A continuing history  &#10;&#10;The Islands' move might come off as more than a bit incongruous given its established existence as a pillar of the US-Israeli axis in UN forums. Glance at any review of General Assembly votes on Israel/Palestine issues and you'll find the Marshall Islands regularly represented in the exclusive anti- Palestine camp, along with a smattering of other obscure Pacific atolls.  &#10;&#10;The fact that justice in Palestine continues to be as elusive as ever, despite nominal support from an overwhelming majority of countries, underscores both the general futility of taking on the powers that be as well as the frequent toothlessness of rulings emanating from UN institutions.  &#10;&#10;The Marshall Islands presumably has some inkling of the force it's now up against.  &#10;&#10;To be sure, Marshall Islanders are well acquainted with the horrors of the nuclear arms industry.  &#10;&#10;The diminutive nation happens to be the site of no fewer than 67 US nuclear bomb tests in the 1940s and 50s, during an almost 40-year period in which the US administered the Islands under a UN trusteeship. As Greenpeace notes, one of these tests involved a bomb 1,000 times more powerful than the one dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.  &#10;&#10;Such machinations have predictably resulted in thorough environmental contamination and continuing health complications for the local population, ranging from radiogenic cancers to babies born without bones.  &#10;&#10;As Marshallese nuclear survivor Lemeyo Abon told the UN Human Rights Council in 2012: "After the [US] testing programme we've had to create new words to describe the creatures we give birth to."  &#10;&#10;Lexical fallout aside, other US contributions to Marshallese culture include the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll, which continues to generate revenue for US corporations.  &#10;&#10;The widespread territorial displacement necessitated by the previous era of fanatical nuclear testing meanwhile highlights the irony of Marshallese government support for the US-funded entity that displaces and otherwise oppresses Palestinians.  &#10;&#10;Of course, human beings are contradictory creatures, and nations composed of lots of human beings are thus inevitably also contradictory. But in assessing the prospects for the Islands' foray into the International Court of Justice, it's worth taking the contradictions into account.  &#10;&#10;Connecting the dots  &#10;&#10;The New York Times points out that the court case "comes as nuclear arms are increasingly being linked to other pressing international issues" such as climate change - which produces rising sea levels that incidentally also pose an existential threat to the Marshall Islands.  &#10;&#10;The Times quotes Marshallese Foreign Minister Tony de Brum on the seemingly parallel threats to survival: "What would it gain mankind to reach a peaceful resolution of the climate change threat, only to be wiped out by a nuclear misunderstanding?"  &#10;&#10;There are certainly common denominators between climate change and nukes - not least that both are filed away in many of our brains under the category of things that we know can swiftly destroy us but would prefer not to think about.  &#10;&#10;However, there appears to be a missing link in de Brum's analysis, because you can't resolve the climate change threat without resolving the business of imperial militarism, in both its nuclear and non-nuclear varieties.  &#10;&#10;The connection between the military-industrial complex and environmental catastrophe is fairly clearly spelled out in Project Censored's annual report from 2010, which confirms the US Department of Defense as the worst polluter on the planet.  &#10;&#10;This is not to imply, obviously, that the US constitutes the one and only problem for the earth; it's simply to draw attention to the superior egregiousness of American earthly violations. Had there been an Ayatollah Khomeini Ballistic Missile Test Site in the mix somewhere, folks might be more willing to connect the dots.  &#10;&#10;While it may not be very coherent of the Marshall Islands to assist the empire in some destructive endeavours and take it to task for others, its nuclear lawsuit should nonetheless be encouraged - if for no other reason than the possibly vain hope that awareness can help combat inertia.  &#10;&#10;And another vain hope: that with attention will come context.  	Marshall Islanders are well-acquainted with the horrors of the nuclear arms&#10;industry.&#10;&#10;
156-maxfactorcantclaimmarilynmonro	guardian	2015-01-09T14:14:47Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/09/max-factor-cant-claim-marilyn-monroe	Sarah Churchwell	Max Factor can’t claim credit for Marilyn Monroe	Max Factor has appointed Marilyn Monroe as its new “global ambassador”, leaving some people bemused at the idea of selecting an ambassador who has been dead since 1962. They seem to suspect this might limit her diplomatic utility. But Monroe represents just what Max Factor wants to resuscitate: the glamour for which the company was once a byword.  &#10;&#10;In the era of classic Hollywood (about 1920-1965), Max Factor ran the only cosmetic game in town, pioneering the use of makeup for cinema, and then, with his sons, adapting and selling those products commercially. Monroe remains one of the most iconic Hollywood movie stars, and Max Factor’s spokeswoman said they chose her because she epitomises their history.  &#10;&#10;“Marilyn made the sultry red lip, creamy skin and dramatically lined eyes the most famous beauty look of the 1940s, and it’s a look that continues to dominate the beauty and fashion industry. It is the ultimate look that defines glamour – nothing else compares,” the spokeswoman said.  &#10;&#10;The campaign will emphasise Monroe’s metamorphosis, it was reported this week, from “mousey” Norma Jeane Mortenson to glamorous Marilyn Monroe, a decision that seems, at face value, rather canny. Certainly it has stirred up a bit of welcome publicity around the campaign, which claims in particular that it was Max Factor Jr’s idea to bleach the star’s naturally chestnut hair to that famous platinum blonde. The ad campaign reads: “From Norma Jeane to Marilyn Monroe. Created By Max Factor.” Hang on, boys. Created by whom?  &#10;&#10;If Max Factor wants to emphasise history it should start by paying a little more attention to it. Monroe had her first – tiny – film role in 1947; she did not have her first starring role until 1952. Throughout the 1940s, she was still “mousey” Norma Jeane. For my book on Monroe, I read every major biography then published, as well as many ancillary accounts – about 300 books in all. Not one reported that Max Factor suggested the aspiring starlet should bleach her hair. I don’t think any of them mentioned Max Factor at all. Instead, nearly all credit a woman named Emmeline Snively, the head of Monroe’s first modelling agency, with whom she signed in 1945.  &#10;&#10;Snively gave Marilyn lessons in fashion, lighting and grooming, and, most biographers report, recommended that she lighten her hair, “because a blonde could be photographed in any wardrobe and in any light”. By 1946 the model Norma Jeane had appeared on 33 magazine covers – quite a feat for a “mousey” young woman waiting to be created by Max Factor.  &#10;&#10;Marilyn Monroe was not created by Max Factor – or by her studio head, Darryl F Zanuck (who hated her); or by her agent, Johnny Hyde, who paid for her to have minor plastic surgery (to the tip of her nose and her jawline) and got her first big roles; or by any of her directors, or husbands, or any other of a legion of men, and a handful of women, who have tried to claim the credit, now including Max Factor’s heirs. She was not created by makeup, in any sense: cosmetics were not sufficient to create Marilyn Monroe, and neither were other people. Emmeline Snively herself said that what distinguished the girl she knew was how hard she worked: “She wanted to learn, wanted to be somebody, more than anybody I ever saw before in my life.”  &#10;&#10;Everyone from Elton John to Joyce Carol Oates (who should know better) has trotted out this tenacious, tiresome story: “ordinary” Norma Jeane was changed by someone else into the glamorous movie star Marilyn Monroe. But Norma Jeane Baker, as she was known in childhood (Mortenson was the name on her birth certificate, but she never knew her father), was always an extremely beautiful girl.  &#10;&#10;An army photographer discovered her when she was 19, working at a munitions factory. She went on to be a popular model on the cover of dozens of magazines before she bleached her hair or focused her look. There was never anything “mousey” about this woman, and when she changed her hair, her makeup, and her name, she didn’t become a different person. She created an iconic style, which she developed in collaboration with her personal makeup artist for many years, Whitey Snyder.  &#10;&#10;No doubt Marilyn attended the Max Factor beauty salon near Hollywood Boulevard in the 1940s, along with hundreds of other young starlets. I have no reason to disbelieve that she may have worked with Max Factor Jr himself in the 1950s, once she was famous. But no one except Marilyn Monroe created Marilyn Monroe, and in 2015 it’s past time for us to give credit to the woman who earned it.  	Sarah Churchwell: It may have appointed Monroe as its new ‘global ambassador’, but all the evidence suggests she was self-made
157-militarycourtspakistan	aljazeera	Mon, 29 Dec 2014 02:10:41 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/military-courts-pakistan-2014122983812353350.html	Rafia Zakaria	Military courts and terrorists heroes	In the early hours of December 24, 2014, mere days after the attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar, a worn-out and exhausted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif took to the airwaves. He had just concluded a marathon ten hour meeting with the chief of army staff of Pakistan and he came to the public with some new measures that would be undertaken to ensure that an attack like the Peshawar massacre would never happen again.  &#10;&#10;The most notable and controversial of these was the establishment of special military courts that would try terror suspects for the next two years. In the opinion of the prime minister, and several other political parties, this measure, which would take power away from Pakistan's civilian judiciary, was necessary to win the fight against terror.  &#10;&#10;It is no secret that Pakistani civilian courts have themselves been targets of terror. Just nine months before Peshawar, on March 3, 2014 two suicide bombers unleashed their mayhem inside the District Court complex in Islamabad. Once inside, they lobbed grenades and fired bullets, people scrambled everywhere, papers flew and bodies fell.  &#10;&#10;As happens in the aftermath of every one of the hundreds of bombings that have taken place in Pakistan this year, the attack on the District Court in Islamabad was claimed by one of the terror groups operating in Pakistan.  &#10;&#10;Like the Army Public School attack that would come months later, the aftermath of carnage was grotesque, the bits and pieces of the instruments of justice, papers of pleadings, the black jackets worn by lawyers, spread all over what had become a crime scene.  &#10;&#10;Attacks on courts are not the only problem in the adjudication of terrorism cases. Terror suspects, in the cases where they are even apprehended, are rarely tried let alone convicted. As the war on terror has trundled on, Pakistan's Court system has lacked the security or the power to conduct terrorism trials and produce convictions.  &#10;&#10;In numbers obtained from 2012, it was found that the conviction rate for terrorism cases in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where many attacks were concentrated, was a paltry 4 percent. In Punjab, the situation was not much better. In 2012 the Special Anti-Terrorism Court in that province heard 559 cases against terror suspects and 414 of these ended with acquittals. According to Khurram Khan, a Deputy Special Prosecutor, "Witnesses have a high rate of recanting because of fear or threats in kidnapping for ransom cases [...] Very few people come forward. Since we don't have a witness protection program, they change their statements."  &#10;&#10;In more high profile cases, the witnesses face death threats. Between 1990 and 2009, a time when Pakistan suffered thousands of terrorist attacks and suicide bombings, the acquittal rate in terror cases was 74 percent.  &#10;&#10;The establishment of military courts for a period of two years is supposed to be a solution to all of this. If the military that is bombing terrorist hideouts in the north of the country is also given the task of adjudicating the cases, the new logic goes, terrorists will certainly be punished and tragedies like Peshawar will never happen again.  &#10;&#10;It is a false premise. First, it is not the first time that military courts have been established in Pakistan, subverting and sidelining the country's already ailing civilian courts. On October 17, 1979 not long after General Zia ul Haq took over the country in a military coup, military courts were established (along with a ban on political activity and a muzzling of the Press).  &#10;&#10;The decisions of these closed courts could not be challenged in any civilian courts and once that court was established, any matter could be transferred to its jurisdiction. As a result, over one hundred such courts were established. The powers they gave to the military allowed large-scale arrests and detentions of political workers and journalists. Hundreds of people were flogged and imprisoned simply for participating in normal political activity that was banned under martial law.  &#10;&#10;In the present case, martial law has not been declared in Pakistan; however, turning over the adjudication of terror cases undoubtedly undermines the country's civilian judiciary. First, the secrecy surrounding military courts leaves them open to charges of contravening legal principles and pursuing their own vendettas against this or that terrorist group instead of sticking to the principles of justice and obtaining convictions via fair procedures.  &#10;&#10;Given that military courts in Pakistan do not work under a system of legal precedent, little information exists as to the basis of convictions and acquittals. Moreover, since evidence is rarely made public, plenty of room is created for conspiracy theorists to place doubt on any conviction that is produced under their auspices.  &#10;&#10;A confused Pakistani public, whose anti-imperialist fervour often leads it to championing extremist outfits against what it perceives as US meddling, desperately needs to see the evidence against terror suspects. It is only when the procedures for doing so are clear and transparent that the hearts and minds vulnerable to conspiracy theories that blame foreign hands will be forced to confront extremism as a home grown issue.  &#10;&#10;The aftermath of every terror attack sees a burgeoning of just this sort of denial, whetted and promoted by groups themselves; the consequent moral murkiness makes it impossible for a Pakistani public to see terrorism as a black and white issue. It is only where the evidence against the evil masterminds of blasts and bombings is openly available and fairly presented will it be impossible to ignore.  &#10;&#10;Second, the low conviction rate in civilian courts is a problem; but it is one that can and should have been solved by providing protection to adjudicators, witnesses and other parties instead of rendering civilian courts altogether irrelevant.  &#10;&#10;The Pakistani army undoubtedly possesses the capability to do this and does it regularly for its own leaders. Similarly civilian security outfits regularly protect police officials, Parliamentarians and other office holders, all of whom roam the country with heavy security cordons that are not available to lawyers, judges and witnesses in terror cases.  &#10;&#10;Finally, the establishment of military courts resurrects the old military- civilian schism from the dregs of Pakistani history and leaves the issue of extremism languishing in the middle.  &#10;&#10;The memory of the old military courts and their excesses against pro democracy agitators and writers who opposed martial law may be distant but is not forgotten. The scepticism of the military and its machinations refreshed by this latest announcement is something that will only weaken what should be in Pakistan a united front against extremism.  &#10;&#10;The old narrative of pro-democracy activists harassed by military courts can easily be hijacked by today’s extremists, who can present themselves as similarly beleaguered and innocent, their convictions illegitimate because they were handed down by military courts. On the shoulders of such familiar manipulations, they will not be condemned convicts but heroes.  &#10;&#10;Terror is a people's problem in Pakistan, with nearly a thousand deaths in over 372 attacks just this year. The extremists who are wreaking this havoc must be accountable to the people, via judicial institutions that serve the public.  &#10;&#10;The evidence has to be seen by all and the rules made plain and clear. The consequence then would be an unequivocal condemnation untainted by conspiracy and paranoia and constructed on fairness. Ultimately, winning the war against extremists requires mobilising Pakistan's public against terror; military courts cannot achieve this crucial goal.  	Establishing military courts to try terror suspects is likely to exonerate&#10;them in the eyes of the Pakistani public.&#10;&#10;

Oil prices have collapsed by about 40 percent since this year's peak in June. The plummeting oil prices have had negative consequences on economies across the world, from Moscow to Caracas to Tehran.  &#10;&#10;The situation is particularly bad in Russia where the shock of shrinking energy revenue is doubled by a monetary crisis. Just in the past week the Russian rouble lost 17 percent of its value in two days; its exchange rate to the US dollar has collapsed by over 50 percent since the beginning of the year.  &#10;&#10;Balancing an oil-dependent budget  &#10;&#10;The energy crisis has its origin in a global surplus of crude oil supply resulting from a rapid expansion of oil production in the US. In order to dissuade additional investments in production of shale oil and tar sands in North America, and wedge a war on market shares, Saudi Arabia has voluntarily gone far above its previous OPEC production commitment. Some have seen this move as a plot by the Americans to punish countries like Iran and Russia.  &#10;&#10;Indeed, the sharp decrease in oil prices to $60 per barrel is far below the breakeven point for countries such as Venezuela and Iran who need $140 per barrel to balance their budget and continue with their policies of social spending and subsidised imports of vital goods. The Russian economy is also very vulnerable to such price fluctuations as the energy sector accounts for about half of the state's revenues and a quarter of its gross domestic product.  &#10;&#10;Putin's gamble to assume that the West would not confront him over Ukraine because of energy security concerns was a miscalculation of the forces at play. The shrinking oil revenues coupled with the economic sanction packages have destroyed investors' confidence in the Russian economy, resulting in record levels of capital flight and a plunging rouble.  &#10;&#10;According to the Russian ministry of economic development, food prices in Russia will increase by 12 percent by the end of this year, and conservative estimates for the first months of 2015 already set inflation at 10 percent.  &#10;&#10;The recent announcement that Moscow was considering developing its own independent space station is just another smoke screen to hypnotise the Russian population. At the current rate of economic misfortunes, the Kremlin might not even have the financial means to design it on paper.  	Plummeting oil prices and a sinking rouble reveal the real limits of Moscow's&#10;inflated ambitions.&#10;&#10;
159-mosulcitydeathrow	aljazeera	Tue, 09 Dec 2014 08:49:32 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/mosul-city-death-row-20141275406466428.html	James Denselow	Mosul - a city on death row	December 9 marks the six-month anniversary of ISIL's capture of Mosul. The capture both put ISIL on the map and simultaneously threatened to fundamentally redraw it. Coverage of the low level civil war in Iraq had long disappeared off the front pages with a war weary western public happy to be "out" of a complex conflict that seemed to have no end. The boldness of ISIL's sweep through the region and the taking of Mosul was the trigger that sparked a new focus on Iraq and put US warplanes back in the sky, but the city itself was quickly forgotten.  &#10;&#10;Today, Mosul is a city on death row enduring both a terrible present and the potential of a worse future. Initial ideas of a swift retaking of the city were dispelled by the ousting of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and the emergence of US President Barack Obama's anti-ISIL coalition. ISIL has proved to be a resilient opponent and while its march forward has been held up in Kobane, Mosul remains under the black flag.  &#10;&#10;In November, Deputy Governor of Mosul Nuraddin Kaplan said that "the sooner the operation begins the better. The more time that passes, the harder it will become". Moves to retake Mosul are in the pipeline but I would argue that the priority should be given to the strategy of prompting a collapse from within as opposed to a destructive attempt to take it by force. ISIL's predecessors, "al-Qaeda in Iraq", struggled to turn from capturing large urban areas to governing them and reports out of Mosul would suggest a similar trend is at play.  &#10;&#10;What information there is that manages to come out paints a bleak picture under ISIL rule. In October, the Guardian reported "severe shortages of food and water, no functioning public institutions, and the local economy in a state of near collapse".  &#10;&#10;The school system has been "ISIL-ed" with an education tax imposed, genders segregated and subjects such as art banned. Christian homes and Shia shrines have reportedly been looted and displaced residents of Mosul testified to Al- Monitor that ISIL had arrested up to 25,000 people between June and October.  &#10;&#10;We've also learnt the ISIL-style of city governance elsewhere and in particular in Raqqa, their nominal capital. An incredibly brave piece of citizen journalism shot by a resident in a hijab showed a city dominated by young, bearded men with guns on every street corner imposing both their ideas of urban management and social control. Prayer and conservative appearance is strictly enforced and executions, even crucifixions, are commonplace. There is a bitter irony that residents of Raqqa have swapped one police state for another.  &#10;&#10;A smart strategy would seek to win Mosul from within. ISIL's ability to attract disillusioned Iraqi Sunnis is being met by new Prime Minister Haider al-Abbadi's far more inclusive vision for the country. Appointing a defence minister from Mosul and finally agreeing on an oil sharing agreement with the Kurds is evidence of this work in progress from the new premier. Abbadi's appeal to Iraqi nationalism and sensitivity to tribal and sectarian dynamics must be able to offer a bigger pull than the ISIL offer of a dysfunctional caliphate. Residents of ISIL-controlled Raqqa have spoken of feeling like "strangers in their own city".  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;Effective propaganda can help split Iraqi members of ISIL from their often foreign leadership. This won't be easy, reports have suggested that ISIL has decided to shut down most mobile telecommunications inside the city, perhaps conscious of the need to protect their battle for hearts and minds.  &#10;&#10;The alternative is far more dangerous for the city. US intelligence estimates that ISIL has the weapons to fight for two years. A rejuvenated Iraqi army that has put competency, sectarian and "ghost soldiers" issues aside is estimated to need some 80,000 troops to "take" the city. Supposedly accurate US weapons destroyed a large part of Fallujah in order to "win it" back in 2004. With this in mind, there is a high chance Mosul would be hit even harder leaving a trail of rubble and refugees strewn across the north of the country.  &#10;&#10;The fate of Syria's second city, Aleppo, must serve as a warning as to the future of Iraq's second city, Mosul. An effective and joined up political and military strategy led by Iraq's new government must make the residents of Mosul hate the caliphate and, at tremendous risk to themselves, take on ISIL from within rather than allow their city to become yet another Middle East urban graveyard. Mosul is a city of immense history but currently stares at the fate of becoming history itself.  	Six months on from its capture by ISIL, Iraq's second city has vanished from&#10;the headlines.&#10;&#10;

The 42-year-old French Muslim policeman was executed on the sidewalk of Paris' 11th borough - the enclave where Charlie Hebdo's headquarters is located.  &#10;&#10;Merabat was shot, point-blank, by one of the three assassins, minutes before they broke into Charlie Hebdo's offices, and slaughtered the magazine's top editor and celebrated cartoonists.  &#10;&#10;The coverage of the "Paris shootings" centred almost exclusively on Stephane Charbonnier, Georges Wolinski, Jean Cabut and Bernard Verlhac - the prominent and unyieldingly provocative minds behind Charlie Hebdo.  &#10;&#10;The first victim, Ahmed Merabat, was purged from the headlines. The political and representational ramifications that come with highlighting Merabat's victimhood cannot be ignored. First, it complicates the broader narrative that rigidly caricatures Muslims as terrorists, outsiders and marginals. And second, refutes the state-sponsored indictment of Muslims in France as perpetrators of subversion, instead of law-abiding citizens.  &#10;&#10;Muslim and French  &#10;&#10;Apart from the obvious tragedy, the Charlie Hebdo killings manifest the baseline that Muslim identity is only relevant - and indeed newsworthy - when the subject is standing behind the gun. Not in front of it. In most everywhere in the world, but especially France - the architect of modern Islamophobia.  &#10;&#10;Muslims comprise a considerable percentage of the French polity. Islam is the nation's second biggest religion, and figures place the Muslim population at 5 percent to 10 percent of France's 66 million citizens.  &#10;&#10;Islam's size, and demographical rise, has spurred some of the most draconian policies against Muslims in modern times. The headscarf ban in 2004, followed by illegalisation of the niqab, or face covering, in 2010, codified core Islamophobic ideas. This legislation also functioned as a firm and fervent declaration by the state that Muslim and French identities were at odds and irreconcilable.  &#10;&#10;The French laicite model provided the structural underpinnings to carry forward Islamophobic legislation. But more nefariously, guise it under the banner of state-sponsored secularism.  &#10;&#10;Expectedly, the religious expression bans disparately impacted French Muslims. In addition, they chilled bodily and verbal expressions of Muslim identity. The state aim of compelling secularisation upon its Muslim citizenry was based upon the civilisational binary, and ultimatum, to choose between "Islam and the West", "Muslim lands or France".  &#10;&#10;Despite this ultimatum handed down from the state, the overwhelming majority of French Muslims exercised their faith amid pervasive bigotry. And simultaneously, embraced their national identities as Frenchmen and women.  &#10;&#10;Extreme voices from within the state, and French civil society, looked to the three terrorists as representatives of the nation's 3 to 6 million Frenchmen and women. Collateral indictment of French Muslims, by politicians and media alike, infused with an already fervent culture of Islamophobia on the ground, will surely incite violent backlash against Muslims and Muslim communities in the country.  &#10;&#10;Although unimaginable before Wednesday, French Islamophobia stands to become far more severe and strident. The conflation of the terrorist's acts with France's Muslim population, from the perspective of hatemongers, holds the latter vicariously liable. This connection, that links three deviant actors with an entire faith and millions of disconnected citizens, will fuel rabid backlash against Muslims in France, and more than likely, claim additional victims.  &#10;&#10;Centring Muslim victims, instead of villains, would mitigate the backlash considerably. In addition, focusing on the heroics of Merabat, instead of the evil of the three terrorists, asserts - and inserts - a competing narrative that France's Muslims are everyday citizens: Citizens with jobs, families, and interpretations of Islam that condemn violence, and contradict the malignant caricature of the faith constructed by the state.  &#10;&#10;Ahmed Merabat was more than a victim. He was far more than merely a Muslim. He, in both life and especially in death, stands as an archetype for the overwhelming majority of French Muslims.  &#10;&#10;A law-abiding citizen, Merabat harmonised his religious identity with the responsibilities of being a Frenchman. He was both French and Muslim, an existential integration eviscerated by the longstanding Islamophobic discourse in France, and ignored by the media firestorm following the attack.  &#10;&#10;Although the first victim of the attack, Ahmed Merabat's story was shot down from the news headlines. And his name and face absent from the ongoing stream of reports and narratives emanating from Paris on Wednesday. Inserting him into the story, and countering the barrage of vile Muslim representations with a rebuttal of victimhood and valour, will likely save lives in France.  &#10;&#10;Most importantly, retelling the story from the perspective of Ahmed Merabat will not only reveal that Muslim and French identity are reconcilable, but also resilient.  	The story of the police officer killed in the Charlie Hebdo attack is no&#10;longer in the headlines - why?&#10;&#10;
161-mybraintumouracousticneuroma	guardian	2015-01-12T16:28:09Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/12/my-brain-tumour-acoustic-neuroma	Christine Sherry	My brain tumour will be removed this week, and I can be thankful	On the morning of my diagnosis I rush to get ready for work. It’s 6am and I make a cup of black tea. As I carry it across the room, even though I’m being careful, I spill most of the boiling liquid, burning my hand. What’s wrong with me, I think.  &#10;&#10;By 10.30am my GP will telephone me at work with the results of a brain scan I had a couple of days before: an acoustic neuroma, sitting behind my right ear, 42mm in size – a brain tumour. The GP says that, so as not to delay things, he’s faxing the referral to neurosurgery right away for urgent attention. Faxing?  &#10;&#10;“Any change,” he says, “go to A&E.;”  &#10;&#10;“Change? What does that mean?” I ask, becoming more alarmed with every word he says.  &#10;&#10;“Have you been sick?” he asks.  &#10;&#10;“No.”  &#10;&#10;“That’s good.” I feel sick.  &#10;&#10;Diagnosis is a long, arduous path that is difficult to navigate. People get sick of you being sick and stop listening. To the untrained eye I look fine. But look closer and you’ll see that I can’t close my right eye, so it doesn’t blink. My face is sagging on the right side, I get sores on the right-hand corner of my mouth due to the drool that manages to escape because of facial weakness on that side.  &#10;&#10;Less obvious are the hidden symptoms. Right-sided facial numbness; overwhelming fatigue; tinnitus and reduced hearing in my right ear; a lack of co-ordination leading to an overpowering unsteadiness. All because I have this 42mm tumour that is taking up space in my head, slowly strangling the nerves relating to hearing, balance and facial sensation.  &#10;&#10;I feel stupid for not noticing and not pursuing some of the symptoms when I first experienced them years ago. I listened to others too much when they told me it was normal and didn’t listen to myself when I knew it was not.  &#10;&#10;There is a certain amount of relief when you finally get a diagnosis, especially one so definitive. At the end of November, the moment I found out, work sent me home and there I have been ever since.  &#10;&#10;Later that week I get a call from my bank. “Sorry for not calling,” I say, “I’ve had a pretty rough week.” I nearly tell them I’ve just found out I’ve got a brain tumour, but I catch myself. I realise how powerful that news is. It can get you out of almost anything.  &#10;&#10;I’ve felt the power every time I’ve said it, but I still don’t believe it’s happening to me. My sister had breast cancer three years ago and it’s taken all this time to stop the illness dominating her life. She has stopped obsessively searching for lumps, and says: “It’s history, old news, like it happened to someone else.”  &#10;&#10;Will I ever acknowledge the reality of what’s happening to me? I’m a 41-year- old woman, married, with no kids by choice. Children would mess up the vice- like grip my husband and I like to have on our lives. My morning commute takes an hour and a half so I read prolifically. I manage a small IT team at a prominent university. Apart from reading I love to cook. That’s who I am: work, reading and cooking. Sounds boring, but I loved it. I haven’t finished a book since being sent home from work. And don’t ask me what’s for dinner. I’ll become dithery and confused, and eventually settle on cheese and crackers.  &#10;&#10;After the relief of diagnosis, fear sets in. I know the snail’s pace at which the NHS usually moves, so watching it jump into action induces panic in me. Within a couple of days, the hotshot neurosurgeon calls. He tells me it is a slow-growing tumour that I have probably had for years and that a few more weeks while they plan my operation won’t make any difference. He tells me that as acoustic neuromas go, this one’s big, but the good news is it’s benign, it’s not cancer, though it must come out and soon. Then the bad news – I will lose all hearing in that ear and one side of my face may be permanently paralysed from the operation. The news that I didn’t have cancer didn’t register; I was too busy counting my losses.  &#10;&#10;A few days later I went to a support group for people with brain tumours, where I met people with brain cancer. Their lumps were in places like the memory, speech or personality part of their brains, and for some the prognosis wasn’t good. The phone call they got from their doctors was much worse than mine. I came away feeling grateful, devastatingly so.  &#10;&#10;It sounds vain, but facial paralysis bothers me more than deafness. People will be able to see there is something wrong. I worry that they’ll stop seeing me and see only a problem with my face. Not satisfied with taking half my hearing, the surgeon may take away my smile, my frown and that weird raised eyebrow look I’ve inherited from my dad. Not being able to express myself in full feels like I’m losing a big part of who I am. Admittedly, that is a woman who has worked in London for more than 20 years, trained in the art of remaining expressionless and speaking to no one. Now I smile or speak to strangers, luxuriating in my facial movements. I find much more to smile about nowadays.  &#10;&#10;The internet tells me these types of tumours grow at a rate of about 1mm a year. If they have a spurt they might make it to 2mm a year. Has the tumour been growing all of my life? I think back to key moments: did I miss out on promotions due to the fatigue of a growing tumour? I did a degree part-time a few years ago and got a 2:1. I now think my certificate should say 2:1 (with a brain tumour).  &#10;&#10;The morning after my diagnosis I was woken up by The Voice. Wake up, it said, there’s lots to do. It has been telling me what to do ever since, and so far it has never been wrong. We all have that voice, but the busyness of our lives causes it to fade into the background. Never has mine been so loud.  &#10;&#10;Do yoga, it will improve your balance.  &#10;&#10;Call your brother who you haven’t spoken to in two years.  &#10;&#10;Write a thank-you letter to the doctor who diagnosed you.  &#10;&#10;Tell them you’re scared before you have that brain scan.  &#10;&#10;Write a will.  &#10;&#10;My operation, a craniotomy, is planned for this coming Thursday. I have two main worries. The first is the horror of surrendering myself to it. I have to turn up at the hospital at 7.30am. They are trusting me to have eaten or drunk nothing for at least six hours. Like an inmate at a prison, I will have my possessions checked in. They will give me a gown to wear that is not my own. Then I will say goodbye to my husband, not knowing when I will see him again. Depending on the hotshot neurosurgeon’s schedule I may have to wait a number of hours, empty-bellied and frightened. Eventually I will have one side of my head shaved before they put me to sleep.  &#10;&#10;Don’t make me do this voluntarily. Treat me like a wild animal running through the woods, take me out with a sedative dart when I am cooking or doing my favourite yoga pose. Then let me wake up when it is all over.  &#10;&#10;Don’t tell me I am brave. The people who choose to get involved with me are the brave ones. My husband, for picking me up every time I fall over when I lose my balance physically – and metaphorically. My mother, for clearing her schedule for as long as it takes to get me better. People like my yoga teacher, who didn’t run a mile when I approached her for help, but instead restored some of my balance and made me feel strong.  &#10;&#10;My second worry is something I’ve never been good at in my life. Now I must face it head-on – the unknown. The doctors can’t tell me how long my hospital stay will be. Will they need to open me up again because my brain is bleeding? Will I have to have a shunt fitted because fluid isn’t draining from my head? Will the surgeon sneeze and nick my facial nerve?  &#10;&#10;Most suffering is in the worry. It means I have to live in the lacuna of uncertainty, embracing not knowing and carrying on, a new skill I practise daily.  &#10;&#10;I know that if you take my life as a whole this is an interruption. This will end. I refuse to make it who I am, my identity. Rather, it is an experience, one that leaves its imprint on my body. It has brought my life into sharp focus and revealed what I have to be thankful for: people, strangers and intimates for their kindness and well wishing; my tenacity and determination for carrying me through; and as much as I’m trying to shake it off, my plan for creating a freezer-full of food to be eaten post-op.  &#10;&#10;I am ready.

162-nationalgalleryportraitinequal	guardian	2015-01-20T12:22:20Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/20/national-gallery-portrait-inequality-museum-privatise-staff-wages-squeezed	Polly Toynbee	Inside the National Gallery, a portrait of modern inequality	The National Gallery’s colonnaded splendour radiates across Trafalgar Square a sense of the importance of art in Britain’s national life. But the reality inside is far less glorious. The 400 gallery assistants are about to be outsourced to a private company against their will, to squeeze pay and conditions. A ballot by their union, PCS, closes this week, calling for a five-day strike in protest.  &#10;&#10;All day they guard the nation’s treasures: not automata, but well-informed, if untrained, guides who like to be asked questions, know where paintings are, are glad to advise nervous visitors unsure what to look at. Some have worked there for 40 years, some are younger, many former art students. Ben, who has been there for over a decade since art school, is an artist when not at work stopping people poking the paintings. His favourite beat is the impressionists and Van Gogh, where he sends the ditherers: all assistants have their preferences, he says (Poussin and the French classicists being the least popular).  &#10;&#10;A letter to staff from the director, Nicholas Penny, says all gallery services go out to tender in April, something no other national gallery or museum has done. That includes visitor services, school bookings, public information and even complaints. As Tupe – Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) – regulations require, staff will transfer to a private company on the same terms, but that’s weak protection: they can be sent to work anywhere in that company. As one fearful gallery assistant says: “I came to work at the National Gallery, but I could be transferred to a supermarket car park.”  &#10;&#10;This is the only national museum in London not paying the living wage. A tangle of pay rates means that older staff (predominantly male) are paid more than newer (predominantly female). But even if men and women’s pay were equalised, many of the older staff would still lose out. The gallery’s grant is being cut, so it needs to make more money with extra paid evening events. Staff are willing – but expect extra pay. Management says negotiations went nowhere, so they have to go nuclear: let a private company get tough with them. Some would leave: they note that the security firm CIS, brought in to staff the recent Rembrandt exhibition, took away the chairs used by the gallery’s own guards. That’s how private companies profit from these contracts: as old staff leave, new staff can be hired at any pay rate.  &#10;&#10;One gallery trustee I spoke to admitted that CIS had been brought in to run the Sainsbury wing to give the gallery staff a fright. CIS, if you look at its website, mostly provides heavies to guard empty buildings, not talk to the public. Most trustees, I’m told, would like to keep the staff in-house.  &#10;&#10;What happens in hard times is always the same: spreadsheets show the most crushable item is staff. Numbers are cut and squeezed hard for longer hours. Vital breaks in a long day are eliminated. Changing into your uniform or taking your tea break has to happen on unpaid time. It’s easier to let ruthless companies to do the dirty work, so squeamish managers can wash their hands of consequences. Both sides will now go to Acas: there is still time to pull back from this privatisation too far.  &#10;&#10;This shedding of long-term employees is emblematic of low-pay Britain, where a million public jobs are being lost. Public servants are more unionised than other workforces, and so irksome to managers who eye a commercial world of 19th century employment practices – lump labour on zero hours, temp agencies, free interns, the bogus self-employed free of national insurance. The public servants’ ethos, their attachment to the civic realm, has been systematically trashed as mere unionised self-interest.  &#10;&#10;What’s afoot at the gallery explains why pay is falling as a share of GDP. Galloping inequality is the result of a million such decisions employers think prudent, mainly because everyone is doing it. The derelict Low Pay Commission has let the minimum wage itself fall £1,000 in real value since 2008. The Tory call last week for higher wages was breathtaking dishonesty, echoing the TUC’s “Britain Needs a Pay Rise” campaign. The government has huge sway over pay. If it demanded the living wage not just for its employees, but also from every contractor and supplier, then national pay norms would rise instantly. If the Low Pay Commission set higher minimums appropriate to each sector, like the old wages councils, larger companies could pay decent salaries according to profitability.  &#10;&#10;The Joseph Rowntree Foundation’s latest report finds 40% of families with children living below a minimum threshold of decency. Most are in work – but earning too little to buy what a majority of the public in focus groups consider essentials for participation in society: no drink or cigarettes, £5 a fortnight for eating out, £40 for Christmas food, one week’s UK holiday.  &#10;&#10;That takes an income of £20,400 a year for a couple with two children – which is almost £3,000 more than National Gallery assistants earn. GDP growth is near invisible to the 8 million squeezed hardest, by this government’s deliberate choice: average income loss since 2010 is £33 a week. Now the government promises full employment – but what kind? Most new jobs are low paid, precarious and part time. For all George Osborne’s hi-vis posturing about his sham “northern powerhouse”, the latest figures from the Centre for Cities show how far the gap between the south and the rest has widened.  &#10;&#10;At Davos this week, central bankers will echo the fashionable view that accelerating inequality is the real economic risk, a danger to capitalism itself. Oxfam tells them 1% of the population will by next year own more of the world’s wealth than the other 99%: in Britain, the top 1% has soared away, and the bottom 10% has done worst while paying the highest proportion of its income in taxes: 47%. But no sign yet that the Davos set is worrying unduly: by Epiphany – 6 January – FTSE 100 chief executives had already earned more than a year of the average wage.  &#10;&#10;How do you wrest back wealth from them? Restoring power to unions would help, ensuring every workplace is offered union membership. Instead, Cameron’s manifesto will make strikes near-impossible, with a 40% ballot threshold unknown anywhere in the democratic west. That’s a reason to hope the ever- patient attendants at the National Gallery resist being cast out to G4S, Serco and the rest– and remain as treasured employees of us all.  &#10;&#10;• This article was amended on 20 January 2015. An earlier version said: “Oxfam tells them 1% of the population will next year own 99% of the world’s wealth”. This has been corrected to: “Oxfam tells them 1% of the population will by next year own more of the world’s wealth than the other 99%”.

163-natonuclearrelapse	aljazeera	Wed, 31 Dec 2014 12:29:39 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/nato-nuclear-relapse-2014123161917509924.html	Ian Klinke	NATO's nuclear relapse	Moscow's latest tests of intercontinental missiles and its parading of nuclear capable strategic bombers have rightly prompted international concern. In December 2014, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov implied that Russia might be moving nuclear weapons to Crimea.  &#10;&#10;From violations of airspace to near mid-air collisions, the number of incidents between Russia and NATO has soared dramatically, increasing the danger of an unintended escalation. Yet, it is rarely mentioned that NATO, too, is back in the game of nuclear deterrence.  &#10;&#10;Washington has recently sent its nuclear capable B-2 and B-52 to Europe for training missions with its NATO partners. It also continues to test intercontinental ballistic missiles. Most problematically, the western military alliance is currently modernising the air-launched nuclear gravity bombs that fall under NATO's nuclear sharing initiative.  &#10;&#10;It is a warm afternoon and thick clouds hang over the houses and farmyards of Buchel, a small village in western Germany and home to 20 of NATO's remaining thermonuclear bombs on European soil. Or so we can only speculate, for the exact location of these approximately 180 air-launched B61 weapons is of course secret.  &#10;&#10;The local baker smiles uneasily when I ask her about the base and is quick to assure me that there is nothing to see. After a 20-minute walk through muddy fields, I can glimpse a large barbed wire fence on the horizon and what seems to be a succession of bunkeresque fortifications. A biting smell of kerosene creeps up my nose.  &#10;&#10;A sign warns me that soldiers may make use of their weapons if I enter. As I walk back across the fields, I frighten a herd of deer that scramble into the bushes. Suddenly, a jet plane soars into the sky with a deafening thunder. In the event of a nuclear war, it would most likely be heading East from here.  &#10;&#10;Designed in the 1960s for use by high-speed aircraft, the thermonuclear B61 is a versatile weapon that comes both as an intermediate range strategic and a short-range tactical weapon with a wide variety of yields.  &#10;&#10;A relic of the early Cold War, it is not just a US but a "NATO weapon" in that its stationing and delivery also involves non-nuclear member states, such as Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey.  &#10;&#10;Tactical nukes are particularly problematic because their short range provides the missing link between a localised conventional war and a highly improbable global exchange of strategic nuclear missiles between Moscow and Washington.  &#10;&#10;Tactical nuclear weapons are no status quo weapons. Their battlefield purpose increases the chance of a nuclear escalation, which is why the superpowers removed most of them from Central Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  &#10;&#10;If everything goes to plan, the controversial B61 weapons will be modernised by around 2020. This "life extension programme" is not simply an initiative to replace rusty old nukes with shiny new ones, but an attempt to increase their accuracy, to replace free fall with precision guided bombs.  &#10;&#10;Ultimately, this will transform the B61 into a new kind of weapon and undermine any pretence that the West is still in the game of denuclearisation.  &#10;&#10;Interestingly, plans to modernise the B61 were initiated in April 2010, only shortly after NATO decided to scrap its nuclear missile shield in Eastern Europe and in the same month that the two largest nuclear powers signed a new Strategic Arms Reductions Treaty.  &#10;&#10;How does NATO explain this nuclear relapse precisely at a time when the alliance had just "reset" its relations with Russia? And what role does the B61 play in the Ukrainian proxy war?  &#10;&#10;Jamie Shea is famous in Brussels for his rhetorical skill, expressive body language and London twang. "He could sell you a landmine if he wanted to", an activist once told me about the man who spun NATO's war against Serbia to a lethargic European public 15 years ago.  &#10;&#10;The alliance's Deputy Assistant Secretary General has come to University College London to talk to students about the Ukrainian crisis and Europe's new security architecture. Charming his audience with jokes and anecdotes, Shea tells the story of an underfunded alliance that urgently needs to up its military game if it wants to stand up to Putin's Russia.  &#10;&#10;He is excited about NATO's new "very high readiness joint task force" and about new and larger planned NATO manoeuvrrs in Eastern Europe. One topic he has precious little to say about is the alliance's nuclear policy.  &#10;&#10;When I prompt him, Shea explains that while the life extension programme was originally meant to provide NATO with a bargaining chip for future nuclear disarmament talks with the Kremlin, Russia's involvement in Eastern Ukraine fundamentally altered the strategic context, rendering the B61 "once again a part of NATO's deterrence posture".  &#10;&#10;"I'm not nostalgic for the Cold War", he laughs, "but you have to prepare for Cold War mark two even if you don't want it". In this, Shea is on the same page as US Secretary of State John Kerry who recently claimed that the crisis in Ukraine was calling NATO "back to the role that this alliance was originally created to perform".  &#10;&#10;Why this relapse to what Shea calls "the nuclear game"?  &#10;&#10;The first part of the answer lies in NATO's recent failures. Clearly, the stand off with Russia is a welcome distraction from its fiasco in Afghanistan and the alliance's lack of a purpose in the absence of Milosevic or Gaddafi. Yet, there is more to this than just an identity crisis. NATO, as Trine Flockhardt so aptly puts it, is something of a "nuclear addict" - it hangs on to its nuclear weapons despite frequently declaring its desire to abandon them.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;Both US President Obama and NATO's new General Secretary Stoltenberg are known advocates of nuclear disarmament - but in 2014 their alliance is stepping up its nuclear deterrence and the US administration is pouring $1trn into the future of its nuclear weapons systems.  &#10;&#10;There are obvious pressures behind this nuclear habit, from the nuclear arms industry via hawkish politicians and generals to certain Eastern European NATO members - but the real issue is a lack of public scrutiny. In the UK, the debate about nuclear weapons tends to concentrate on Britain's nuclear submarines and what would happen to them if Scotland declared independence.  &#10;&#10;The US is currently preoccupied with the safety of its nuclear silos. These issues are of course important, but they should not cause us to overlook NATO's nuclear relapse. People like Shea publicly admit their relief that the public has kept so quiet about nuclear weapons since the end of the Cold War.  &#10;&#10;Indeed, governments remember all too well their predecessors' struggles with the peace and anti-nuclear movement of the 1980s. This is why today's NATO does "not want to wake up a sleeping dog", he explains.  &#10;&#10;In 2014, the spotlight briefly returned to that one-time symbol of division in Europe, the Berlin wall. Even Mikhail Gorbachev attended the festivities on November 9, a spectacle of lights, balloons and emotions. Twenty-five years after its fall, the Berlin wall is one of the world's most heavily memorialised sites, a tourist attraction like few other 20th century structures.  &#10;&#10;But while the wall remains the symbol of the Cold War in schoolbooks, op-eds and emotive speeches, it is also a highly problematic one. Rather than representing the threat of mutual nuclear annihilation, it always stood for a much simpler lesson - that of the West's moral victory over the "prison" of real existing socialism.  &#10;&#10;If we want to understand the Cold War in all its self-destructiveness, we need to look elsewhere.  &#10;&#10;A visitor to villages that lie near nuclear weapons storage sites in Europe might be surprised to be greeted by American flags in shop windows and front gardens. This form of identification with US nuclear weapons is puzzling given that these sites would be primary targets in the event of a nuclear war with Moscow.  &#10;&#10;The West is currently too preoccupied with Russia's new nuclear militarism to notice the way that its own military alliance functions as an agent of regional insecurity. Lest we forget, NATO never abandoned its "first use" doctrine. It does not rule out the possibility of being first to go nuclear in an armed conflict with another nuclear power.  &#10;&#10;Some will argue that "now is not the time" to start a public debate on NATO's tactical nukes, but even these critics would have to concede that the modernisation of the B61 further compromises the West's position in the 2015 revision of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. If a new arms race is to be prevented in its infancy, the sleeping dog might have to learn to bark and bite again.  	Under the public radar, NATO is modernising its tactical nuclear arsenal.&#10;&#10;
164-newcongressmyfellowrepublicans	foxnews	2015-01-09T16:00:23Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/01/09/new-congress-my-fellow-republicans-here-your-chance-to-prove-can-lead/	Scott Brown, Scott Brown	New Congress: My fellow Republicans, here's your chance to prove you can lead	  &#10;&#10;This week marks a new era in American government. For the first time in the six years of the Obama administration, Republicans took the reins of power in both houses of Congress, bringing divided government to our nation’s capital.  &#10;&#10;With this new power comes not only responsibility, but also real challenges and opportunities.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Yes, the newly empowered Republicans in the Senate have the ability to control the floor and try to break through some of the gridlock and dysfunction associated with the failed tenure of now Minority Leader Harry Reid.  &#10;&#10;Instead of bottling up all the legislation that’s been passed by the GOP House without ever letting it see the light of day, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can start moving things forward with up or down votes and a full, fair and thorough amendment process.  &#10;&#10;He has pledged to get back to regular order and help re-establish trust between the American people and Congress. But even more importantly, the Senate can get to work on the issues of real importance to the people who elected them. Instead of pushing petty, politically motivated bills, or not voting just to protect one of the Democratic members from taking a tough vote, the Senate can focus on things that will have a direct impact on the American people.  &#10;&#10;I am encouraged to see that the Keystone XL Pipeline is on the top of the docket. This common-sense, environmentally sound project will not only create good-paying jobs for both unions and non-union members, it will also increase our domestic supply of oil, helping to keep prices low and more money in people’s pockets, and it will help to reduce the influence of foreign governments.  &#10;&#10;It’s unfortunate that President Obama continues to impede progress on Keystone and is standing with the radical fringe of his party rather than the overwhelming majority of the country.  &#10;&#10;Likewise, now that the elections for leadership are over, House Speaker John Boehner needs to move immediately to unite his caucus and focus on the overwhelming areas of agreement within the GOP. Given that Republicans now boast their largest House majority since the late 1920s, it’s not surprising that there have been, and will be, minor areas of difference within the caucus. But the things that unite us are so much more plentiful, and it’s now the job of Speaker Boehner to focus on these issues.  &#10;&#10;I was heartened to see the House Republicans roll out a series of bipartisan jobs bills this week, including legislation called the “Hire More Heroes Act.” This bill would exempt veterans already enrolled in health care plans from the VA or Department of Defense from counting toward the employer mandate under ObamaCare. This is a win-win for both veterans and small businesses.  &#10;&#10;Many businesses are not hiring because of ObamaCare’s many mandates and new regulations, and this measure would be a good first step to help alleviate that problem.  &#10;&#10;Above all, Republicans in Congress have to prove to the American people that they are responsible leaders who will put our country’s interests first by being able to lead and get real results. They need to show that they have learned from the mistakes of the past and will stop lurching from cliff to cliff and forcing self-imposed government shutdowns that only tarnish the GOP brand and make it harder to win future elections.  &#10;&#10;The new Republican Congress needs to make it impossible for the Democrats to falsely portray the Grand Old Party as a group of fire-breathing extremists focused on divisive social issues. History tells us that when we focus on the issues that really matter — such as low taxes, getting our debt and deficit under control, limited government, returning power to the states and a strong and muscular national defense — the American people are with us, and we win elections as a result.  &#10;&#10;The simple reality is that even with a GOP Senate, there is only so much of President Obama’s destructive agenda that we can work on repealing these next two years. Getting rid of ObamaCare and rolling back his overreaching executive orders and memos — that’s not going to happen if a Democratic president succeeds the current occupant in January 2017.  &#10;&#10;We Republicans have a slew of talented candidates who, over the next few months, will throw their hats into the ring and begin the process of running for the White House. The new GOP Congress needs to make sure it provides critical support and issue-oriented ammunition for our nominees — not become unwelcome distractions that will hurt the brand and increase the Democrats’ chances of retaining the White House.  &#10;&#10;Let’s make these next two years count, so that in January of 2017 a newly elected Republican president can take power with robust GOP majorities in Congress and really get this country back on the right path.  	This week marks a new era in American government. For the first time in the&#10;six years of the Obama Administration, Republicans will take the reins of&#10;power in both houses of Congress, bringing true divided government to our&#10;nation’s capital.&#10;&#10;
165-newnhshelplineyouvenothingtolo	guardian	2015-01-11T00:14:22Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/11/new-nhs-helpline-youve-nothing-to-lose-but-the-will-to-live	David Mitchell	Try my new NHS helpline. You’ve nothing to lose but the will to live…	The NHS has had a pretty horrible Christmas, with A&Es; swamped, more than a dozen hospitals declaring major incidents and a bleak midwinter bed shortage worthy of first-century Bethlehem. Various causes have been cited: not enough money, too many ill people, the government, the previous government and GPs. But a major contributory factor appears to be the NHS 111 helpline.  &#10;&#10;That’s the number you’re now supposed to ring if you don’t need an ambulance. Not any time you don’t need an ambulance, obviously. Not, for example, when you need a fire engine or the police instead – stick with 999 for those. It’s for when you don’t need an ambulance, a fire engine or the police but, if you were pressed, you’d have to admit it’s an ambulance that you don’t need least. If you were to pick one of those things you don’t need and try to make some sort of use of it, you’d go for the ambulance. On balance. Because, come to think of it, you might actually need an ambulance. I absolutely can’t think of a simpler way of describing it.  &#10;&#10;It seems that NHS 111 works slightly differently from NHS Direct, which preceded it and was staffed by nurses, in that very few of the people who answer the phone are medically trained. They have no more chance of fixing a human body themselves than someone in an EE call centre has of generating a 3G signal using an alkaline battery and a radio transmitter. They work off a computer system called Pathways which tells them what questions to ask and then, the answers having been typed in, what advice to give.  &#10;&#10;As triage goes, this is flawed. The first stage of it – the decision to opt for 111 rather than, on the one hand, 999 or, on the other, a paracetamol and a lie-down – is conducted by the patients themselves. This ensures that the new service gets a nice mix of those who are definitely dying but don’t want to be any trouble and malingerers who are losing the courage of their convictions. Then the next stage is a sort of medical version of those magazine surveys that claim to tell you whether you’re romantic or sociopathic or spiritual or a typical Scorpio. But, regardless of whether most of your answers are As, Bs or Cs, the system still just advises you to consult someone trained to diagnose whether there’s anything really wrong with you, rather than waste any more time describing your nasty rash to a guy whose last job was cold-calling about missold PPIs.  &#10;&#10;And that’s what causes the trouble for A&E;: the combination of a risk-averse computer algorithm, call centre staff who don’t want blood on their hands and the scarcity of GP appointments on public holidays, weekends and when there’s good skiing to be had, is driving thousands of 111 callers into A&E; to be put on a trolley and ignored like a rum baba in a 70s restaurant.  &#10;&#10;The solution is simple: the algorithm needs some backbone. By which I don’t mean that the decisions should be taken by actual live vertebrates – that’s obviously unworkably expensive. But we need to be honest with ourselves: the whole point of this phone line is to fob people off – to stop them going to hospital, not encourage them. Deep down, they want to be told they’re fine and to stop moaning – otherwise they would’ve dialled 999 – so a new version of Pathways needs to be designed with that in mind…  &#10;&#10;Ring ring. Click.  &#10;&#10;Recorded Voice: We’re sorry that you too have found it necessary to call NHS 111. We apologise for the delay but we’re experiencing extremely high call volume.  &#10;&#10;Hold music: Eye of the Tiger or Feeling Good. The music fades in between the following recorded messages.  &#10;&#10;It’s that time of year. Colds, sniffles – nothing serious, but you know how people are. Bloody hypochondriacs…  &#10;&#10;Not saying that’s you, of course. I’m sure you’re at death’s door...  &#10;&#10;Just hope there’s no one with a burst appendix in the phone queue just behind you, that’s all. Wouldn’t want you to have that on your conscience.  &#10;&#10;Still, nice music, eh? Stirring stuff. I expect you’re feeling better already.  &#10;&#10;Calls may be recorded for subsequent publication as a book of hilarious and embarrassing medical anecdotes. Your continuing to hold will be taken as consent for your name to be used.  &#10;&#10;Each caller will remain on hold for at least 10 minutes. This will thin down the numbers considerably – for various reasons. When the call is finally answered, the following questions will be asked:  &#10;&#10;Q. Thank you for calling NHS 111. Please enter the last seven digits of your NHS number into your HealthSentry device sponsored by Nivea Visage, and read out the resultant 16-letter Medicode.  &#10;&#10;Q. How are you?  &#10;&#10;If answer is “Fine, thanks”, even as a reflex, hang up immediately. It’s worth a try.  &#10;&#10;Q. Have you experienced your current symptoms before?  &#10;&#10;If answer is yes: Well, they didn’t kill you last time.  &#10;&#10;If answer is no: And you didn’t think you might give it a week and see if they clear up?  &#10;&#10;Q. How can you be sure that the way you feel now isn’t how you’re meant to feel and the way you used to feel wasn’t an illness from which you’ve now recovered?  &#10;&#10;Q. Are you aware that, in the vast majority of cases, there’s nothing wrong with the patient that won’t clear up of its own accord?  &#10;&#10;Q. Are you aware that, in a significant percentage of the remaining cases, there’s no effective treatment and so it’s probably kinder to remain undiagnosed?  &#10;&#10;Q. You don’t fancy giving homeopathy a try, do you? It’s very convenient, assuming you’ve got access to mains water.  &#10;&#10;Q. Have you made a will?  &#10;&#10;If answer is no: Don’t you think that’s a priority, instead of wasting time on the phone?  &#10;&#10;If answer is yes: It’s not from one of those will kits, is it? Because they’re about as likely to stand up in court as Oliver Reed after a heavy night. I mean, you might as well just bequeath everything to lawyers now. No, you need a proper one, done by a solicitor. It’s an absolute priority to get that sorted before you let some junior doctor open you up and poke around.  &#10;&#10;Q. On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 means “strongly disagree” and 10 means “strongly agree”, how would you respond to the phrase “We’ve all got to go some time”?  &#10;&#10;David Mitchell’s new book, Thinking About It Only Makes It Worse, is published by Guardian Faber (£18.99).

166-newyearresolutionforvaloseicar	foxnews	2015-01-06T16:09:49Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/01/06/new-year-resolution-for-va-lose-icare-pin-embrace-real-reform/	Pete Hegseth	New Year's Resolution for the VA: Lose the 'ICARE' pin, embrace real reform	  &#10;&#10;Visit a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs facility and there’s a good chance you’ll see a VA employee sporting a shiny lapel pin that reads “ICARE.”  &#10;&#10;That’s an acronym for “Integrity, Commitment, Advocacy, Respect and Excellence,” a list of words that represents the VA’s “core values.” As one of VA Secretary Bob McDonald’s first orders of business, the ICARE pins were intended to signal a renewed commitment to service and honesty at the troubled VA.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;During his confirmation in August, McDonald promised he would lead the push for “unprecedented and critical cultural change and accountability” at the VA. Instead, five months later, most of what veterans have to show for it are watered-down reforms and a new slogan.  &#10;&#10;Or, as a few of our members put it: “We pass historic VA reforms through Congress, and all we got was a lousy ICARE lapel pin.”  &#10;&#10;It’s not enough to hire a slick PR firm to devise a catchy acronym that says you “care”; what matters to veterans and their families is that you demonstrate your “care” through the results you deliver. That is why the ICARE lapel pins are such an affront to those of us who fought so hard for reform last year.  &#10;&#10;So how can veterans get the results we want to see at the VA in the new year? We need to continually press McDonald and his department to take a much more decisive approach to reform that gets to the real root of the problem: an entrenched and unaccountable bureaucracy. After all, it’s much easier to put on an ICARE pin every morning than it is to shoulder the shame that too many VA executives should feel. Make no mistake about it; corrupt employees and a bloated bureaucracy are the problems that must be addressed — and urgently.  &#10;&#10;To be fair to McDonald, there have been limited signs of progress at the VA, thanks to reforms passed by Congress that bring greater accountability and more patient choice to what is now the government’s second-largest department.  &#10;&#10;For example, Sharon Helman, the director of the VA’s Phoenix Medical Center, which was ground zero for the secret waiting list scandal, was finally terminated in November — but only after more than 200 days of paid administrative leave. A handful of other VA officials have also been forced out, but only after being given a chance to retire with benefits.  &#10;&#10;It’s a start, but not nearly adequate considering the depth and breadth of dysfunction. McDonald must keep up — or preferably turn up — the pressure in the year to come.  &#10;&#10;Moreover, the VA needs to stop resisting the expansion of patient choice for veterans that Congress has mandated. The department has been slow-walking the implementation of the reform law’s provisions that would allow veterans who are facing a wait of more than 30 days to see a physician, or those who live far from VA facilities to consult with a medical provider in the private sector. This is an important measure that will ensure veterans more timely access to care, while bringing much needed competitive pressure to bear on the VA care system.  &#10;&#10;If he is truly going to put the care of veterans above the agency he leads, McDonald should make good on his promise and champion patient choice expansion, rather than treat it as a pilot project.  &#10;&#10;In all honesty, the great risk for McDonald in the new year is that he’ll “go native” and embrace, defend and shield the dysfunctional culture of the department he promised to change. That’s a risk, and a temptation, for anyone who is charged with leading a large bureaucracy. We cannot allow it.  &#10;&#10;Perhaps McDonald’s slowness in taking action is part of a strategy of presenting himself as a friend to VA employees in order to earn their trust and confidence. But it’s not bureaucrats who have lost trust in the VA — it’s veterans, taxpayers and Congress. It remains to be seen whether he’ll reveal himself to be a tough-love manager who will stand up to the self-serving bureaucrats who have proven time and again that they “care” more about their job security and compensation than the patients they are supposed to serve.  &#10;&#10;If McDonald, and the entire VA, want to show that they truly “care” about veterans in 2015, they should resolve to take off the cheesy ICARE pins and get real results for veterans.  &#10;&#10;My advice to veterans, their families and advocates is this: Keep up the pressure. The VA bureaucracy is expecting that with scandals fading from the headlines, attention will move elsewhere. All they want is to don their pins and go back to the same old way of doing business.  &#10;&#10;Our job is to keep that from happening.  	It’s not enough to hire a slick PR firm to devise a catchy acronym that says&#10;you “care”; what matters to veterans and their families is that you&#10;demonstrate your “care” through the results you deliver.&#10;&#10;

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) (2008 Getty Images)  &#10;&#10;May 14, 2014: Pedestrians wait for cabs across the street from The New York Times in New York. (AP)  &#10;&#10;Editor\'s note: The following column first appeared in the Washington Times.  &#10;&#10;The now-consumed 2014 has been perfectly described by some commentators as the year when facts died.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Politicians, mobs in the streets and their willing accomplices in the media swamped us with lies, obfuscations or riots manifest because, as author Thomas Sowell has noted, “What matters today is how well you can concoct a story that fits people’s preconceptions and arouses their emotions. Politicians like New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, professional demagogues like Al Sharpton and innumerable irresponsible people in the media have shown that they have great talent in promoting a lynch mob.”  &#10;&#10;None of this is unique to 2014, however, nor is the aptitude to stir up a lynch mob the exclusive purview of politicians. It has been both the vocation and avocation of liberal media darlings for a very long time.  &#10;&#10;In 2014, with almost perfect timing and illustrating the farce of the left, a liberal favorite — New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd — was exposed by the Sony email hack for just how much hypocrisy and contrivance rules her world.  &#10;&#10;An Internet search of Ms. Dowd brings up a whole host of approving profiles and interviews over the years, with a particular column considered by her sycophants as one of her greatest accomplishments: the “takedown” of former New York Times investigative reporter Judith Miller.  &#10;&#10;Ms. Dowd provided what many thought was the coup de grace against Ms. Miller when she wrote that column about her then-colleague at The New York Times, excoriating Ms. Miller for her coverage of Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction WMD) leading up to the Iraq war.  &#10;&#10;Ms. Miller, you see, had done the unthinkable. She reported what her investigation found on the issue, which also happened to be what the Bush administration and scores of other governments had also determined: Saddam was pursuing a WMD program and an untold number of those weapons were developed and undeclared.  &#10;&#10;As her fellow liberal colleagues piled on Ms. Miller, Ms. Dowd’s column, dripping in ridicule and moral authority, condemned the reporter for being a “stenographer” for the Bush administration.  &#10;&#10;Ms. Dowd complained Ms. Miller’s work “fit too perfectly” with what the White House had been asserting about WMD. In other words, Ms. Dowd accused Ms. Miller of being too close to her subject, essentially of colluding with others, of selling out to make someone happy or to further a shared agenda.  &#10;&#10;It was absurd and petty. But what we didn’t know at the time was that it was also a perfect case of projection.  &#10;&#10;In emails revealed late last year by the Sony Pictures hack, Ms. Dowd, The New York Times‘ supposed paragon of journalistic ethics, was discovered to have assured a Sony executive that she would be sure to make her “look great” in a column, and appeared to promise to show the column to the executive’s husband, a former Times reporter, beforehand.  &#10;&#10;After the column ran, more emails were exchanged, with Ms. Dowd telling the executive, “I hope you’re happy … let’s do another.” After her subject declared the columnist her “favorite person,” Ms. Dowd gushed, “You’re mine! You’re amazing.”  &#10;&#10;Ms. Dowd has since denied that she provided the column in advance. That’s possible. So was it a draft that was provided? And by someone other than herself?  &#10;&#10;For those who might suggest this mistake of Ms. Dowd’s was a one-off, issues of character inform everything we do. Hypocrisy doesn’t sneak up on you once. It’s part of how you relate to the world.  &#10;&#10;Bill Keller, executive editor of The New York Times from 2003 to 2011, confirmed to the left-wing blog Media Matters in 2011 that the newspaper’s treatment of Ms. Miller was due to politics and to assuage the leftist critics. Mr. Keller confessed, “I let a year go by when a lot of people, particularly people on the left, became disenchanted with the Times because they saw it as having been cheerleaders for the war. I think I could have saved the paper a lot of trouble and some damage by dealing with [Ms. Miller’s reporting] much sooner.”  &#10;&#10;Facts do tend to be pesky things, as Ms. Dowd and the rest of The New York Times crew found in 2014.  &#10;&#10;After years of morally superior, self-righteous preening, they had a problem: Judith Miller was proven right about WMD in Iraq. Revealed in a 2010 Wikileaks document dump, The New York Times finally wrote a 10,000 word story on “abandoned chemical weapons” in Iraq as it became evident our troops continued to be injured by them and their existence could no longer be denied.  &#10;&#10;The New York Sun suggested the Times’ story be viewed as “journalism’s longest correction,” and was “designed to try to extricate the Gray Lady from all these charges about how President George W. Bush and his camarilla lied about the danger of Saddam’s chemical arsenal. It turns out that Iraq was littered with thousands of shells containing poison gas, like Sarin.”  &#10;&#10;In that 2005 column attacking Ms. Miller, Ms. Dowd dramatically warned her readers if Ms. Miller remained a reporter at The New York Times, the newspaper itself would be at risk.  &#10;&#10;Ten years later, now with the Times on the verge of collapse, forced retirements, layoffs and plunging ad revenue, the facts are teaching a lesson in irony and hypocrisy to Ms. Dowd and everyone else at the Times who jettisoned the truth to soothe jealousies and pander to politics.  	In 2014, with almost perfect timing and illustrating the farce of the left, a&#10;liberal favorite — New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd — was exposed by the&#10;Sony email hack for just how much hypocrisy and contrivance rules her world.&#10;&#10;

A former FBI director hired to look into how the NFL pursued evidence in the Ray Rice abuse case says the league should have investigated the incident more thoroughly before it initially punished the player. Robert Mueller released the report Thursday, Jan. 8, 2015, saying that the NFL had substantial information about the case and could have obtained more. (AP Photo/Jason DeCrow, File)  &#10;&#10;Last year NFL star Ray Rice committed a single act of unforgettable and inexcusable violence against then fiancee Janay Palmer. This year he and his now wife Janay hope he will be back in the NFL, a platform he has used to aggressively combat adolescent bullying in the past. As the founder of an anti-bullying organization, I hope he gets a second chance and continues his anti-bullying crusade this year, and for many years to come. The couple is infamous for what went down in a New Jersey casino elevator, where Ray knocked Janay out with one left-handed strike, leading to his arrest on assault charges. Rice was later cut by the Baltimore Ravens and suspended by the NFL. He won his appeal and is now clear to play, if a team will have him.  &#10;&#10;The couple\'s botched press conference in May, where he failed to publicly apologize to Janay, led many to condemn him further. Fox Sports wrote, "Most of what (Ray Rice) said left the public and media shaking their heads." I met with Ray the day before that botched press conference while working at the Raven’s training camp to help rookies and free agents better handle experiences with high school and college bullying. I encouraged him, when the time was right, to continue his anti-bullying crusade. His eyes watered because he deeply wants to be a hero to children again.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Why would an anti-bullying advocate want Rice to have a second chance and to stay in the anti-bullying game under the right circumstances? Because Ray\'s deplorable but isolated act does not come close to the damage caused by bullying, and it doesn’t make him a bully. We need more people like him who, once amends are made, to combat what is now the #1 form of child abuse in America. Rice is even willing to get political to fight bullying. He supported "Grace\'s Law," a landmark, anti-cyberbullying law passed in Maryland. “I truly hope that he continues his anti-bullying work,” says Christine McComas, mother of the late Grace McComas, 15, whose suicide is attributed to cyberbullying. “His help was probably the single biggest factor that led to the new anti-cyberbullying law named after our daughter, which has already saved lives. His empathy and support of our family in our worst hour will never be forgotten. I have four daughters, so I’m sensitive to domestic violence. I have no reason to believe he is a serial abuser, and think he should be given the chance to redeem himself. Maryland owes a lot to that man.”  &#10;&#10;Also, people within the Ravens organization who knew Ray well told me that what happened in that elevator was inexcusable, yet also did not define Ray’s real character. Matt Lauer of the TODAY Show, while interviewing Janay, said he received numerous phone calls from people who know Ray personally. They also said that what happened in that elevator was an aberration from his usually strong character.  &#10;&#10;Rice is guilty of a single act of inexcusable violence; an act Janay says didn’t happen before and hasn’t happened since that fateful day. By contrast, most acts of bullying are premeditated, and don’t stem from flashes of anger but rather contempt and disdain toward a target. Bullies, including domestic abusers, wed power to fear as part of a psychological campaign of cruelty in order to dominate, control, intimidate and isolate another. Yet Janay says Ray’s behavior before or after this one event includes none of this. In nearly a year since the punch felt around the NFL, not one woman has come forward to accuse Rice of similar abuse. This supports Janay\'s statement that what happened was an isolated incident, something Janay said during her TODAY Show interview with Matt Lauer. According to Janay, good may come from this single and deplorable act. She told Lauer that though the claims of serial abuse are false, “God chose us for a reason.” The couple also says that this incident, which pushed Ray into mandatory and intense counseling, made them better people, including how it compelled them to rededicate themselves to their Christian faith. If we can’t give the Rice family the benefit of the doubt, then let’s give them the benefit of time this new year, which will tell us whether he has truly seen the light. I believe that time will do more than tell. I believe it\'s on his side in 2015.  &#10;&#10;Paul Coughlin is an expert witness regarding bullying and the law, a former newspaper editor and is the author of numerous books, including Raising Bully- Proof Kids. He is the Founder of The Protectors: Freedom From Bullying—Courage, Character & Leadership for Life, which provides a comprehensive and community-wide solution to adolescent bullying in schools, summer camps, faith-based organizations, and other places where bullying can be prevalent.  	Last year NFL star Ray Rice committed a single act of unforgettable and&#10;inexcusable violence against then fiancee Janay Palmer. This year he and his&#10;now wife Janay hope he will be back in the NFL, a platform he has used to&#10;aggressively combat adolescent bullying in the past.

The NHS is to be rescued with £2bn from the banks (Tories), with £2.5bn from cigarettes (Labour), with £1.5bn from London mansions (Labour), with the same £1.5bn for Scottish nurses (Scottish Labour) or with £8bn “from the proceeds of growth” (the Lib Dems). Or it can always be rescued with “efficiency savings” (everyone, for the past decade).  &#10;&#10;Meanwhile six hospitals have declared “major incidents” (which admittedly have a broad definition under NHS guidance). Accident and emergency delivery is at its worst for a decade. There is a chronic shortage of A&E; doctors and beds. The NHS boss, Simon Stevens, lets not a month pass without demanding money with menaces from ministers, and usually getting it. His doctors, long adept at financial terrorism, have the politicians by the short hairs. The result is political panic.  &#10;&#10;When any service is free, demand is unlimited. Aneurin Bevan feared the NHS would put doctors out of work as people got richer and less ill. He was wrong. As they got rich they lived longer and demanded more care. Even where care costs money, as in America, demand soars. The NHS needs 5% more cash a year in real terms to meet rising demand, without improvement. There is no way this can continue indefinitely.  &#10;&#10;So what happens? Where demand is unlimited, supply must be rationed somehow. As economists know, if it is not rationed by payment – as in most insurance- based health services – it is rationed “by congestion”, by queueing. That is precisely what is now happening in the NHS. The service worsens, the rich move to private insurance while the poor queue, for hours, days, months. Britain’s cancer performance shows the result. More Britons die of cancer delays than in insurance-based health services.  &#10;&#10;The NHS frontline – surgeries and A&E; departments – are crippled by the strain of trivial visits for minor injuries, repeat prescriptions or just lonely people and confused immigrants.  &#10;&#10;There is no way this can be sustained sufficiently or efficiently. Desperate attempts at internal pricing have led hospital trust A&E; departments to close because they lose money. They cannot charge or turn away even drunks and nuisance patients.  &#10;&#10;More and more doctors are now pleading for payment for frontline treatments, recoverable in certain cases. There is no other way any government can restore 24-hour care and a “personal” GP service. Rationing by payment may offend tradition, but rationing by chaos is cruel. Britain is just one step away from a network of private A&E; centres. That would be a catastrophe for NHS staffing. Yet no politician has the courage to propose what is needed to stop it.

170-nigeriaconfrontbokoharummuhamm	guardian	2015-01-14T14:19:15Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/14/nigeria-confront-boko-harum-muhammadu-buhari-elections	Remi Adekoya	Nigeria must confront Boko Haram – step forward, Muhammadu Buhari	Nigeria is at war. In the past week alone the Islamist militants Boko Haram have slain hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people across north-eastern Nigeria, some with the help of child suicide bombers, including a 10-year-old girl. In recent months they have sacked entire towns and villages, and are now masters over 20,000 square miles of territory.  &#10;&#10;About 1.7 million people now live in Boko Haram’s declared “caliphate”, while 1.5 million have been displaced from their homes as a result of the violence. With a month to go before presidential elections, Africa’s most populous country is losing the war against a fullblown Islamist insurgency. So what is the Nigerian government doing about it?  &#10;&#10;In 2013 President Goodluck Jonathan, who is up for re-election, declared war on Boko Haram and dispatched the Nigerian army to battle them. But Boko Haram not only fended off the army’s offensive, it ended up being emboldened by the obvious ineptitude of the Nigerian forces. Soldiers meant to be protecting cities and towns have sometimes taken to their heels when Boko Haram’s fighters arrived on the scene, leaving inhabitants at the mercy of the Islamists.  &#10;&#10;But the problem isn’t that Nigerian soldiers are cowardly, it is that they are woefully under-equipped, under-trained and far too demotivated to tackle the well-armed Boko Haram fighters. The governor of Borno, the state most affected by Boko Haram, has publicly stated that the Islamists are much better armed than the soldiers.  &#10;&#10;The reason the Nigerian army is in such poor shape is simple: corruption. The military’s annual budget exceeds £4bn, but rather than equip and train frontline troops, there are complaints that much of the funds end up in senior officers’ pockets. Soldiers who complain have been known to be court-martialed and sentenced to death for “mutiny”.  &#10;&#10;As commander-in-chief, this is where Jonathan could have been expected to step in. But rather than confront the army top brass the Nigerian president has opted to bury his head in the sand and place the blame for Boko Haram’s success on everyone bar himself. When news emerged last year of the kidnap of the Chibok girls, instead of reacting swiftly Jonathan hesitated for two weeks, suggesting there was no kidnap, only a plot by his political opponents to discredit him.  &#10;&#10;At other times he has shrugged off Boko Haram’s deadly attacks as little more than the unavoidable localised version of global jihad, implying with his tone and body language that hundreds of citizens getting killed every week is something Nigerians will simply have to get used to. After a deadly bomb blast killed more than 100 people in the capital Abuja last year, Jonathan was pictured dancing away at a political rally the next day.  &#10;&#10;Travelling around the country over the past few weeks, my impression is that Nigerians are increasingly looking to the main opposition presidential candidate, Muhammadu Buhari, a former general and one-time military ruler, as the country’s best hope of tackling Boko Haram. Under “normal” conditions Buhari, a conservative Muslim from the north who ruled Nigeria with an iron fist from 1983-85, would have little hope of support in the country’s southern, predominantly Christian region. Without outstanding charisma, eloquence or competence on policy detail, the 72-year-old Buhari has already made three unsuccessful bids for president.  &#10;&#10;But after a year in which Boko Haram and government corruption has dominated local headlines, the ex-general has two things going for him: a reputation for strong leadership and incorruptibility. He is probably the only prominent Nigerian politician today who isn’t hounded by allegations of embezzling public funds.  &#10;&#10;A president with military experience to take on corrupt army officers would surely serve as a morale booster to the Nigerian soldiers battling Boko Haram. Granted, the ex-general has no magic wand to make the militants simply vanish. But in this period of existential crisis, Nigeria may need a wartime leader who can project reassuring strength and provide a plausible strategy for overcoming the insecurity in the country. Time is running out.  	Remi Adekoya: The elections are an opportunity to depose ineffectual Goodluck Jonathan and install a strong leader with a reputation for incorruptibility
171-nigeriaimpeachmentpresident	aljazeera	Mon, 15 Dec 2014 03:02:40 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/nigeria-impeachment-president-2014121513935514619.html	Casmir Igbokwe	Nigeria's old impeachment games	Recently the former president labelled many Nigerian federal legislators as thieves and looters. According to him, they indulge in extorting money from departments, contractors and ministries. "When the guard is the thief," Obasanjo lamented,"only God can keep the house safe and secure."  &#10;&#10;With what is presently playing out at the National Assembly of Nigeria, Obasanjo may be right after all. Currently, some lawmakers are purportedly plotting to remove President Goodluck Jonathan from office. About 65 out of 109 Senators are reportedly involved in the plot.  &#10;&#10;These anti-Jonathan lawmakers have told whoever cared to listen that they would table the president’s sins on December 16, 2014 when they reconvene from their current recess.  &#10;&#10;Chief among the president’s reported sins are failure to contain the raging insurgency in the north; refusal to sign some bills; and alleged unauthorised expenditure of 1.7 trillion Naira (about $9.5bn) on the oil subsidy fund in 2011.  &#10;&#10;True, the security situation in the country is not palatable, but it has always been so since 2009 when Boko Haram started its violent uprising. No doubt, the president needs to demonstrate that he is capable of putting the terrorists to rout.  &#10;&#10;But then, why are the senators just waking up to the existential realities in Nigeria? Why are they just discovering that the president spent more than what was approved for the oil subsidy fund in 2011?  &#10;&#10;The point is, the lawmakers desperately need financial and political support to pursue their campaigns for the general elections coming up in February 2015. And the best way to get this, I suspect, is to blackmail the president with impeachment or removal. In a bid to retain his seat, the president is supposed to calm them down by greasing their palms and supporting their bids for re-election.  &#10;&#10;For many Nigerians, the legislators are actually acting true to type. In August 2002, when the nation was preparing for the 2003 general elections, the National Assembly waved the impeachment flag against the then President Obasanjo.  &#10;&#10;The lower chamber, the House of Representatives, gave the him an ultimatum to resign within two weeks or be removed. They accused Obasanjo of incompetence and abuse of office. At the end of the day, the so-called impeachment turned out to be a storm in a teacup.  &#10;&#10;It has become a tradition that whenever the lawmakers want anything done in their favour, they arm-twist the executive with threats of probes or impeachment.But most of the probes end up an exercise in futility. Nobody is punished. No credible result is released.  &#10;&#10;In 2009, the then Special Adviser on Petroleum to the president, Dr Emmanuel Egbogah, alleged that oil companies took some senators to Ghana to feed and bribe them to oppose the oil and gas reforms being initiated by the federal government. Naturally, the senators were angry. They called for a probe of the allegations.  &#10;&#10;Senate President David Mark thundered then, "There is going to be a serious public hearing…because when people begin to beckon at their whims and caprices to label us in the way they want, we should take it seriously." Nothing concrete came out of this.  &#10;&#10;There was also a probe of the power sector reforms undertaken by the then President Olusegun Obasanjo. The Ndudi Elumelu-led committee of the House of Representatives that probed the rot in the power sector spent millions of Naira in the course of conducting their investigations. They turned in many volumes of the report on the probe. At the end, the House set up an ad hoc committee to review the report.  &#10;&#10;Of course, the review committee dropped the probe report. It reportedly accused the Elumelu panel of lacking understanding of the nature of power sector contracts. Hence, it exonerated the Obasanjo-led government of mismanaging funds for power projects.The rot in this power sector is still haunting Nigerians up until today.  &#10;&#10;Undoubtedly, our lawmakers are incurable lawbreakers. Sometimes, they engage in physical combat in the chambers. Sometimes, their unruly behaviour leaves even children wondering why such supposedly mature individuals have become soup-guzzling elders.  &#10;&#10;They collect jumbo pay only to pass a few bills and devote most of their time in shadow-boxing. A good number of these legislators, for instance, never sponsored any bill since they were elected. Some care less about the interest of their constituents and don’t report back to them. They have also failed in their oversight of ministries and government agencies. The House has committees in charge of different government ministries. But what some members of these committees do, sometimes, is to demand monetary inducement to pass the budget of these ministries. In fact, money is the name of the game.  &#10;&#10;Last year, The Economist of London reported that Nigerian legislators were about the highest paid in the world. According to the newspaper, with the basic salary of $189,500 per annum, the Nigerian legislator earns 116 times the country’s Gross Domestic Product per capita of $1,600.  &#10;&#10;Still, many of the legislators frequently agitate for increase in their already bloated salaries and allowances.  &#10;&#10;For instance, in 2010, some members of the House of Representatives, not satisfied with their personal quarterly allocation of 27.2 million Naira ($153,000), wanted their quarterly allocation increased to 42 million Naira ($234,000) for each of them. The budget of the House could not accommodate it then. Hence, the lawmakers reportedly suggested collapsing the capital budget of the House to take care of their request.  &#10;&#10;It would serve the Nigerian nation better if the job of the lawmakers is on a part-time basis and their salaries are drastically cut.That way, many of them will not find it attractive to contest the position for the sake of the lucrative pay, not to mention thinking of issuing threats they will never carry through.  	Why are Nigerian lawmakers threatening President Goodluck Jonathan with&#10;impeachment?&#10;&#10;

At his press conference on Friday, President Barack Obama said that Sony "made a mistake" by not releasing its film "The Interview" on schedule. He said: "We cannot have a society in which some dictator some place can start imposing censorship here in the United States."  &#10;&#10;The dictator in question is North Korea's Kim Jung-un. Sony acted following both a major hack of its computer files and, more ominously, a threat that any US showing of the comedy film that culminates in the assassination of Kim, could produce another 9/11 type attack.  &#10;&#10;The threat was issued on December 16 by an outfit calling itself, the "Guardians of Peace", which also claims to have been behind the hack attack on Sony. It promised a "Christmas gift" for the American people.  &#10;&#10;Within 48 hours of the threat, and following pleas by companies owning most of the cinemas in the US, as well as by the shopping centres in which the cinemas are situated, Sony pulled the film, which is quite a coup for whoever orchestrated the assault on the company.  &#10;&#10;The original hack cost Sony an estimated $170m while withdrawing the film will cost the company another $45m it cost to make plus whatever the film would have taken in at theatres and from home release. This is a big deal.  &#10;&#10;It is worth noting that it is not 100 percent positive that Pyongyang is behind the Sony hack or the 9/11 warning. Yes, the FBI asserts (with its customary assurance) that North Korea is guilty on both counts but leading cyber security experts say (with equal certitude) that the evidence of North Korean responsibility is sketchy at best.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;As for the North Korean regime itself, it flatly denies any involvement while at the same time issuing threats against the US that are even more blood curdling than the one issued by the "Guardians of Peace" (who may or may not be the North Koreans themselves).  &#10;&#10;Whoever the culprits are, they did not inflict major damage on the US. Contrary to those who are screaming that by pulling the film, the US surrendered the concept of freedom of speech, it is not the US government that pulled the film. In fact, Obama said that if Sony had talked to him first, he would have told the company to show the film as planned.  &#10;&#10;But Sony did not talk to Obama because its decision to withdraw the film had nothing to do with the US or its national interests but with the financial interests of the multinational corporation itself. Multinationals do not, for reasons implied in the very term multinational, act with an eye on any flag.  &#10;&#10;These are businesses and profit, not patriotism, is their guide.  &#10;&#10;It is, therefore, ridiculous to accuse the US of yielding to the threat of a foreign dictator. It didn't. Sony did and, from the point of view of its shareholders, it probably did the right thing. Losing $45m in production costs for "The Interview" is nothing compared to Sony's potential liability if some catastrophe occurred at a showing of the film in Los Angeles or Washington, DC.  &#10;&#10;This is not to say that there are no foreign policy implications of this debacle. Sony's decision to make a comedy about the assassination of the North Korean head of state was a terrible idea that has only worsened the US' already terrible relations with this very unstable nuclear-armed nation.  &#10;&#10;If reports that a State Department official read the script and approved of the assassination scenario are true, that is troubling. Driving an already unbalanced head of state off the deep end is clearly not something diplomats should sign off on.  &#10;&#10;Of course, certain elements in the US government want to see an increase in tensions with North Korea, and maybe even an attempt at "regime change".  &#10;&#10;Although Obama was careful to say that North Korea's purported actions constituted "cyber vandalism" but "not an act of war", Senator John McCain, who becomes chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee next month, said on Friday that it is indeed an act of war to which the US must respond.  &#10;&#10;Former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich agrees, as do eager warriors in both political parties, those who promoted war with Iraq and now oppose a nuclear deal with Iran. Those two countries are, of course, charter members of former President George W Bush's original "Axis of Evil" regimes that he and his allies wanted eliminated.  &#10;&#10;The third member was North Korea.  	Sony's decision to pull the film 'The Interview' has more to do with business&#10;and profit than with national interests.&#10;&#10;

Peremptory demands from Congress won't	The new Republican leadership in Congress has indicated that new, punitive measures against Iran might be among its first orders of business, even though diplomatic talks with our international alliance are entering a promising new stage. If my colleagues are serious about restraining Iran’s nuclear ambitions, they will resist the temptation to intervene and instead let our negotiators finish the job.  &#10;&#10;Altering the terms or objectives of the talks would amount to moving the goalposts when the end zone is in sight – with potentially devastating consequences.  &#10;&#10;November’s four-month extension of the “P5+1” negotiations (called so because of the participation of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany) confirmed both the difficulty of the remaining issues and the importance of continuing to negotiate. We are still several steps short of a complete and lasting termination of Iran’s nuclear weapons program, but the current interim agreement between Iran and the international community – known as the Joint Plan of Action (JPOA) – is a vast improvement over 18 months ago, when Iran’s nuclear program was still expanding and shrouded in secrecy.  &#10;&#10;While the JPOA is only a temporary agreement, Iran has complied with it and verifiably frozen and rolled back its nuclear program, demonstrating that it is willing to take negotiations seriously.  &#10;&#10;Congress could play an important oversight role while negotiators work to build on this progress and secure a verifiable and lasting nuclear agreement with Iran. But acting peremptorily to demand specific concessions from Iran could destabilize the diplomatic balance needed for negotiations to both continue and ultimately succeed. It would be unwise, for example, to lay out unrealistic or overly-specific requirements for a final agreement to be acceptable to Congress.  &#10;&#10;Likewise, the nuclear negotiating table is not the place to compel Iran to clean up its act on issues unrelated to nonproliferation. Iran engages in an array of behaviors that the US and the international community find unacceptable, such as persecuting political opponents and religious minorities, and supporting terrorist organizations like Hezbollah. But we must not insist that everything be solved before anything is solved; a nuclear agreement is and should be our first priority, and such an agreement could facilitate progress on other fronts.  &#10;&#10;Imposing new or less flexible economic sanctions – which has been proposed by a number of my congressional colleagues, including Senators Kirk and Menendez – could do great damage to our prospects for a nuclear agreement with Iran. New punitive action could strengthen Iranian hard-liners and make their withdrawal from the negotiations more likely. Acting unilaterally could also undermine the stability of our international alliance, and thereby actually weaken the existing international sanctions regime.  &#10;&#10;The existing sanctions are, of course, a major reason that Iran is at the negotiating table, and Congress should stand ready to reimpose and strengthen them should Iran violate the terms of the JPOA or any future nuclear agreement. But taking punitive action now could send a message that Congress does not stand behind the negotiators.  &#10;&#10;We cannot lose sight of the fact that a verifiable nuclear agreement with Iran would make our country, Israel, the Middle East and the world much safer. The nuclear talks with Iran could still crumble under the pressure of opposition and distrust both inside and outside Iran. But the United States and the international community must press ahead – because of the security that the removal of the nuclear threat would bring and the dire alternatives we’ll face if negotiations fail.  	Congressman David Price: If my colleagues are serious about restraining Iran’s nuclear ambitions, they have to resist the temptation to intervene in the administration’s negotiations
174-obamaamericastillatwarcongress	guardian	2015-01-06T11:45:10Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/06/obama-america-still-at-war-congress-illegal	Trevor Timm	The greatest trick Obama ever pulled was convincing the world America isn't still at war	The holiday headlines blared without a hint of distrust: “End of War” and “Mission Ends” and “U.S. formally ends the war in Afghanistan”, as the US government and Nato celebrated the alleged end of the longest war in American history. Great news! Except, that is, when you read past the first paragraph: “the fighting is as intense as it has ever been since the U.S.-led invasion in 2001,” according to the Wall Street Journal. And about 10,000 troops will remain there for the foreseeable future (more than we had a year after the Afghan war started). Oh, and they’ll continue to engage in combat regularly. But other than that, yeah, the war is definitely over.  &#10;&#10;This is the new reality of war: As long as the White House doesn’t admit the United States is at war, we’re all supposed to pretend as if that’s true. This ruse is not just the work of the president. Members of Congress, who return to work this week, are just as guilty as Barack Obama in letting the public think we’re Definitely Not at War, from Afghanistan and Somalia to the new war with Isis in Iraq and Syria and beyond.  &#10;&#10;Thirteen years on, the near limitless war authorization Congress passed for the Afghanistan war remains in place, with no sign that Congress wants to even debate revoking it. This is what will allow US troops to continue fighting, despite the mission supposedly being “formally” over. Just a month before Obama made his farcical announcement last week, he signed a secret order to ensure US troops continue to engage in combat missions against various “militant groups” in Afghanistan for all of 2015.  &#10;&#10;The war in Afghanistan is over, the President says. The sky is green, the President says. The sun rises in the West, the President says.  &#10;&#10;Another place the United States is Definitely Not at War? Pakistan, where, according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, the US conducted multiple drone strikes between Christmas and New Year’s Eve, killing at least nine people. We don’t know who died, but the Associated Press assured us they were “militants”, despite the US government’s definition of “militant” having been manipulated beyond comprehension.  &#10;&#10;Another six “militants” were reportedly killed in a drone strike in Pakistan on Sunday, the targets apparently having nothing to do with al-Qaida – they often never do, as we learned from new Snowden documents published by Der Spiegel over the holiday break. (There was yet another American drone strike in Somalia on 30 December.)  &#10;&#10;The US Congress, of course, has steadfastly refused to attempt to place any real legislative limits on drone strikes, even those that have killed American citizens – which, as various scholars have been screaming for years, represent an unconstitutional violation of the Fifth Amendment.  &#10;&#10;Meanwhile, the Defense Department quietly announced a few days before Christmas that, later this month, another 1,300 troops will deploy to Iraq in its ever-expanding undeclared war on Isis. A Pentagon spokesperson emphasized these are Definitely Not Combat Troops, despite the US government’s current definition of “combat” being so narrow that it’s “rejected by virtually every military expert” – not to mention that the troops already in Iraq are already under “regular” fire, according to CNN. The US continues to launch airstrikes against Isis and various other groups in Syria as well.  &#10;&#10;As the new Congress opens in Washington on Tuesday, it once again has the opportunity to formally debate and actually vote on the war against Isis, a constitutional obligation from which America’s politicians shamefully slunk away, preferring instead to campaign for re-election – free of difficult decision-making. Now, almost five months in to a war the administration freely admits will last for years if not decades, hardly anyone seems to care what legal experts across the political spectrum believe: this war is without precedent – and it’s illegal without Congressional approval.  &#10;&#10;Now, the US Congress is not exactly a body known for its nuance and restraint, and there are many reasons why war against Isis remains a terrible idea, but if either the Republican-controlled House and Senate want to make an actual case for war, then that is their prerogative. But vote on it. Because the Obama administration has already gone down a dangerous path wherein the executive branch can unilaterally carry out virtually any war it wants without any official input from Congress.  &#10;&#10;Given the GOP’s newfound hatred of executive power, which the party seem to have conveniently forgotten was pioneered during every Republican administration since Nixon, you’d think Washington’s new majority might want to take this tiny step of debating and voting on the Isis war, as is their own constitutional duty.  &#10;&#10;Republicans would do well to use the president’s own words against him. As Barack Obama himself told the Boston Globe back in 2007:  &#10;&#10;The President does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.  &#10;&#10;Since virtually the entire US intelligence community agrees that Isis, no matter how awful and heinous the group may be, does not imminently threaten the mainland United States, maybe Congress can start off the new year by doing its job and actually voting on something required of them months ago.

But you would be very, very…

Bill Haslam\'s Tennessee Promise program, which offers free tuition to students attending two years of community or technical college. While the president’s plan will certainly make community college accessible to many more students, it is also far from clear that such students will benefit.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Consider that, at present, graduation rates for students at community colleges are dismal: around 25 percent for students who do not transfer, the lowest 6-year completion rate in U.S. higher-education. (For the roughly one-fifth of community college enrollees who do eventually transfer to a four year college, the graduation rate, at 62 percent, is far better.)  &#10;&#10;Despite the president’s best intentions -- absent serious reform -- pressuring community colleges to improve outcomes, graduation rates have no reason to rise. And by directing more students to community colleges without demanding higher standards—students will become eligible for two free years of tuition if they maintain merely a 2.5 GPA, hardly stellar in this age of rampant grade inflation—the president\'s plan might, perversely, worsen graduation rates. To that end, the president insists that participating schools will need to "adopt promising and evidence-based institutional reforms to improve student outcomes." Indeed, the success of his proposal depends on demanding a greater degree of accountability from community colleges, though it\'s not exactly clear what such reforms might entail.  &#10;&#10;A better idea: rather than force schools to follow top-down commands, reward successful schools instead by making eligibility for federal funding contingent on satisfactory completion and employment outcomes. (Alternatively, steer students receiving funding to two-year technical schools, which boast better graduation rates than general-education community colleges.)  &#10;&#10;Regardless of how it all turns out, the president\'s proposal will not solve the larger problems facing American higher education, namely, ever-rising college tuition and student debt. Further, despite his pledge to “[help] every American afford a higher education,” large federal subsidies for community colleges might exacerbate such problems.  &#10;&#10;Flush with new funding, community colleges might, for instance, be tempted to imitate their 4-year peers and increase spending on administrators, frivolous capital projects, and other extravagant amenities. Tuition hikes would, in turn, invariably follow—the brunt of which would be borne by students ineligible for the new federal subsidies.  &#10;&#10;Yet under the Obama plan, even many newly subsidized students would likely not escape unscathed. At present, nearly 60 percent of community college students do not finish their degrees within 6 years of enrolling. As such, it’s likely that newly subsidized students—many of whom will not graduate over the course of their two year subsidies—would inevitably need to worry about tuition increases as well.  &#10;&#10;As more American families and students question the value of a college degree, it’s essential—as the president rightly does—to emphasize that college graduates outperform their non-degree holding peers on a wide range of outcomes. Accordingly, policymakers would be wise to find ways to maximize the value of students’ tuition dollars.  &#10;&#10;Alas, simply enabling more students to attend college, without creating the right incentives to ensure better outcomes, is not one of them.  	Despite President Obama’s best intentions, absent serious reform pressuring&#10;community colleges to improve outcomes, graduation rates have no reason to&#10;rise.&#10;&#10;
176-obamahandscubacastrosmajorvict	foxnews	2014-12-17T19:24:05Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/12/17/obama-hands-cuba-castros-major-victory-but-congress-can-still-stop-it/	Mike Gonzalez	Obama hands Cuba's Castros a major victory, but Congress can still stop it	  &#10;&#10;Establishing ties with Cuba has been on President Obama’s bucket list for some time. Health care -- done. Amnesty for illegal immigrants -- done. Cuba -- next. This last one also has the added bonus point that it puts him right with the international left, which lionizes Castro.  &#10;&#10;And the president will go on picking off the next items on the bucket list for the next two years of his term unless Congress decides to stop him. Should they work up the gumption, lawmakers will find they can do many things to stand up for the prerogatives of the legislative branch.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Obviously, the release of the 65-year-old American hostage Alan Gross should be welcome. His “crime” was to bring computers to Jews on the island. For the last five years, he has been a victim of Cuba’s state terrorism, just as 11 million Cubans have been held hostage by their government for the past five decades.  &#10;&#10;Exchanging three hardened Cuban spies for Gross, however, establishes an insulting moral and legal equivalency. The spies actions led to the death of an American in the 1990s, and they were duly convicted. Their release in exchange for Gross creates an incentive for rogue regimes and individual actors to kidnap Americans all over the world.  &#10;&#10;Not only does President Obama’s action fail to advance freedom in Cuba, it throws a lifeline to Cuba’s dictators, whose current supplier of funds, Venezuela, is on the ropes because of plunging oil prices. It surrenders to the demands for normalization that the Castros have been making for decades.  &#10;&#10;So what can Congress do?  &#10;&#10;Right off the bat, Congress must make it crystal clear to President Obama that he lacks the authority to lift the embargo on Cuba, allow trade to take place between the two nations, let tourists to go to Cuba to bail out the regime or give Cuba have access to capital markets. U.S. law—the Helms-Burton Act of 1996—gives the Congress power to override any action taken by the executive to lift the embargo.  &#10;&#10;In order to lift the embargo, the Cuban government would have to give the Cuban people a number of rights—of association, speech, political activity, etc.—that President Obama obviously failed to secure in his 45-minute conversation with Cuban dictator Raul Castro Tuesday.  &#10;&#10;Congress can also make clear to the president that there are statutory criteria that must be met before his administration can take Cuba off the State Department list of terrorism sponsors. The president must inform Congress that there has been a change of leadership and policies of the Cuban government and that Castro has given assurances that it will no longer support terrorist acts. Can President Obama do any of that?  &#10;&#10;Senators should also make clear that they will put a hold on any ambassador that Mr. Obama nominates to serve in Cuba unless he can guarantee that the Cuban government is no longer a threat to the United States and has decided to grant freedom to people in Cuba. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has already said he plans to do that.  &#10;&#10;Additionally, Congress can look into the possibility of using policy riders in the upcoming DHS appropriations debate in February and the Fiscal Year 2016 appropriations process to deny the president funds for setting up relations.  &#10;&#10;Congress must act because President Obama has been completely feckless in his entire approach to Cuba. He received nothing in exchange for many substantial concessions made to the Communist regime. After five years of “negotiations” President Obama ended exactly where Raul Castro’s demands began five years ago. As Senator Marco Rubio said, President “Obama is the worst negotiator since Carter.”  &#10;&#10;Mr. Obama\'s statement was filled with Havana’s communist talking points, such as affirming that Cubans are poor and unfree because of the embargo, or that Cuba was a U.S. colony. None of that is true, and yet Mr. Obama said it.  &#10;&#10;Congress must act to limit the damage inherent in this Havana Giveaway. Left unchecked, Obama will simply move on to the next misguided item on his bucket list.  	Not only does President Obama’s action fail to advance freedom in Cuba, it&#10;throws a lifeline to Cuba’s dictators, whose current supplier of funds,&#10;Venezuela, is on the ropes because of plunging oil prices.&#10;&#10;

REUTERS/Larry Downing (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS) - RTR41Q8N  &#10;&#10;Editor\'s note: The following article originally appeared in The Hill and on TheHill.com website.  &#10;&#10;Dan Pfeiffer’s office is next to the Oval Office. The cheek-by-jowl location reflects the importance of his job as senior adviser guiding President Obama’s image and message going into his final two years in the White House.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;At the moment, the president and Pfeiffer are on a hot streak. Polls show Obama’s approval numbers climbing.  &#10;&#10;“It’s an 18-point gap [better than] Bush and the same as Reagan’s,” Pfeiffer said, comparing Obama’s current approval rating to that of President George W. Bush and President Reagan at the equivalent point in their second terms.  &#10;&#10;Strong public support is central to the president’s strategy of keeping the loyalty of Senate Democrats. If large numbers of Democrats in Congress run away from a president with bad poll numbers, Republicans can put the president on the defensive for the remainder of his time in office.  &#10;&#10;Major defections by Senate Democrats will also allow the Republican majority in the Senate to stop filibusters and potentially override Obama’s vetoes. The issues at stake range from construction of the Keystone XL pipeline to efforts to change and repeal Obamacare, as well as undo immigration reform, financial regulation, the opening of new relations with Cuba and new limits on greenhouse gases.  &#10;&#10;Pfeiffer does not see any issue where Republicans can expect to undo a presidential veto: “Not one,” he emphasized.  &#10;&#10;The Keystone XL pipeline is the one instance in which Pfeiffer acknowledges that veto may have to be used in the first place. But he does not expect such a move to hurt the president’s revival in the polls. It is an issue, Pfeiffer argued, often cited by Republicans who don’t like the president anyway.  &#10;&#10;But most “people don’t have super-strong feelings about it,” he said. “They are not energized about it, especially at a time of low gas prices. [Polls show] people generally prefer it but this is not a huge issue in their lives.”  &#10;&#10;Pfeiffer also expects constant fights with Republicans on Capitol Hill over the Environmental Protection Agency’s use of the Clean Air Act to better regulate greenhouse gas emissions. “The Republican policy is wrong,” he said. “I feel good about our chances [because] people feel strongly about clean air and clean water.”  &#10;&#10;With his current good poll numbers, the president is able to go on a political offensive despite taking a beating in last fall’s midterms and ceding control of the Senate, as well as the House, to Republicans. Pfeiffer ties the president’s rising popularity to the success of his economic policies but also to the Republican Party’s difficulties with any voter not in the Koch brothers’ tax bracket.  &#10;&#10;“The GOP has huge trouble on cultural affinity,” said Pfeiffer. “Republican tax policies, opposition to regulating pollution, their effort to repeal Dodd- Frank – it all favors the rich…We need to engage them on all that.”  &#10;&#10;“Engage them” is the idea at the heart of the president’s plan for his last two years. The GOP is on defense as it responds to proposals increasing access to community college as well as increased tax breaks for families in need of childcare and with two working spouses.  &#10;&#10;Pfeiffer starts looking around his office for a card recently given to senior staff that reminds them they are in “the Fourth Quarter.”  &#10;&#10;The quote comes from Obama. Pfeiffer tells the story of the president looking at Green Bay Packers’ player Randall Cobb during a rally in Wisconsin and making the case that fourth quarter football is “when big things happen.”  &#10;&#10;In a moment of off-script pique during last week’s State of the Union address, the president reminded Republicans he cannot run for election again because he already beat them in two presidential elections. That confidence leads him to conclude that losing control of the Senate in the midterms is only a momentary set back in the big picture — the total game and the legacy of the Obama presidency.  &#10;&#10;As Pfeiffer told the New York Times in advance of the State of the Union speech, the nation’s economic resurgence under President Obama creates “a Chicken Little problem [for Republicans] — all the doom and gloom they predicted did not come to pass.”  &#10;&#10;The president crowed about “good news, people” in the State of the Union speech: He listed 11 million jobs created by American business in the last five years; more people with health insurance; cuts in the deficit; record stock prices; higher high school graduation rates and lower gas prices, as evidence of his success.  &#10;&#10;“At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits,” the president said. “…So the verdict is clear. Middle class economics works…and these polices will continue to work as long as politics don’t get in the way.”  &#10;&#10;Pfeiffer and other top administration officials think they can further improve their poll numbers by getting Republicans to debate the president’s new proposals for increasing wages for working Americans. Good news in foreign policy is also possible but, unlike most second-term presidents, Obama is not abandoning the domestic agenda.  &#10;&#10;Obama’s poll numbers will not decide the 2016 race for the White House, Pfeiffer said, because the “biggest factor is the popularity of the nominee.” But good polls will prevent Democrats from “distancing” themselves from Hillary Clinton, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) or another other nominee, and lead to better turnout. That is also part of the Obama team’s fourth quarter plan to end the game as winners.  	With his current good poll numbers, President Obama is able to go on a&#10;political offensive despite taking a beating in last fall’s midterms and&#10;ceding control of the Senate, as well as the House, to Republicans.&#10;&#10;
178-obamakeystonevetoclimateactivi	guardian	2015-01-06T19:55:31Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/06/obama-keystone-veto-climate-activism	Bill McKibben	Obama's Keystone veto threat is proof that climate activism works, no matter what the 'insiders' say	When the news arrived from the White House on Tuesday that Barack Obama would veto the GOP’s Keystone pipeline bill – or at least “that the president would not sign this bill” as is – I thought back to a poll that the National Journal conducted of its “energy insiders” in the fall of 2011, just when then issue was heating up. Nearly 92% of them thought Obama’s administration would approve the pipeline, and almost 71% said it would happen by the end of that year.  &#10;&#10;Keystone’s not dead yet – feckless Democrats in the Congress could make some kind of deal later this month or later this year, and the president could still yield down the road to the endlessly corrupt State Department bureaucracy that continues to push the pipeline – but it’s pretty amazing to see what happens when people organize.  &#10;&#10;The fight against the XL pipeline began with indigenous people in Canada, and spread to ranchers along the pipeline route in places like Nebraska. And then, in the spring of 2011, when the climate scientist Jim Hansen pointed out the huge pool of carbon in the Canadian tar sands, the fight spread to those of us in the nascent climate movement. We had no real hope of stopping Keystone – as the National Journal poll indicated, this seemed the most done of deals – but we also had no real choice but to try.  &#10;&#10;And so people went to jail in larger numbers than they had for many years, and wrote more emails to the Senate than on pretty much any issue in history, and made more public comments to the government than on any infrastructure project in history. And all that effort didn’t just tie up this one pipeline in knots. It also scared investors enough that they shut down three huge planned new tar-sands mines, taking $17bn in capital and millions of tons of potential emissions off the table. And it helped embolden people to fight every other pipeline, and coal port, and frack field, and coal mine. The Keystone fights helped spur a full-on fossil-fuel resistance that now mounts a powerful challenge to the entire fossil-fuel industry at every single turn.  &#10;&#10;It’s not as if we’re winning the climate fight – the planet’s temperature keeps rising. But we’re not losing it the way we used to. If the president sticks to his word, this will be the first major fossil-fuel project ever shut down because of its effect on the climate. The IOU that the president and the Chinese wrote in November about future carbon emissions is a nice piece of paper that hopefully will do great things in the decades ahead – but the Keystone denial is cash on the barrelhead. It’s actually keeping some carbon in the ground.  &#10;&#10;The fossil-fuel industry’s aura of invincibility is gone. They’ve got all the money on the planet, but they no longer have unencumbered political power. Science counts, too, and so do the passion, spirit and creativity of an awakened movement from the outside, from the ground-up. So the “energy insiders” of Washington are going to have to recalculate the odds. Because no one’s going to believe that any of these fights are impossible any more.  	Bill McKibben: Our fight, from indigenous people in Canada to ranchers in Nebraksa, now challenges the fossil-fuel industry at every turn. If the president sticks to his word, this will be a landmark
179-obamasbiggovernmentpoliciesdon	foxnews	2014-12-03T12:00:43Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/12/03/obamas-big-government-policies-dont-create-enough-decent-jobs/	Peter Morici	Obama’s big government policies don’t create enough decent jobs	Friday, the Labor Department is expected to report the economy added about 230,000 jobs in November, and the White House will tout the economic recovery has created jobs for a record 57 months in a row.  &#10;&#10;Voters rejected that message by ousting Democrats in the mid-term elections, quite simply because the President\'s recovery has simply not delivered enough good paying, full time jobs.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;In the wake of the financial crisis, unemployment peaked at 10 percent, but the five year recovery has scored only 2.3 percent annual growth and added only about 10 million jobs—a mere 7 percent increase from the recession low of 129 million.  &#10;&#10;President Reagan also inherited a mess—high oil prices, double digit interest rates and unemployment peaking at 10.8 percent. His recovery, over the period comparable to the Obama expansion, registered 4.8 percent annual GDP growth and created 14.3 million jobs—a 16 percent increase from a recession low of 89 million.  &#10;&#10;The difference was governing philosophy.  &#10;&#10;Obama put billions into cumbersome, economically questionable government programs like solar energy, expanded federal entitlements, imposed higher taxes on small entrepreneurs, and burdened businesses and banks with costly and ineffective regulations.  &#10;&#10;Manufacturing and construction—hamstrung by onerous new restrictions on factories and bank lending—have not adequately recovered. Today, both industries employ about 1.6 million fewer workers than before the recession. Lost are many jobs paying more than $25 per hour that once helped undergird the middle class.  &#10;&#10;Democrats, such as Senator Charles Schumer blame new technologies and advocate yet more big government, but innovation that raises labor productivity has been a dominant force since the first axle and wheel, and Obama’s failures indicate paucity of Schumer’s prescription.  &#10;&#10;More striking has been the failure of U.S. manufacturers to apply home-grown technologies to more effectively boost domestic manufacturing, increase exports and compete with imports.  &#10;&#10;During the 2008 campaign, Obama promised to improve U.S. competitive performance by addressing China’s undervalued currency, which artificially disadvantages U.S.-based factories, but hasn’t. Since the Obama recovery began, the trade deficit with China has increased $190 billion, destroying 1.6 million American jobs.  &#10;&#10;In addition to the Keystone pipeline, the Administration continues to block petroleum development off the Atlantic, Pacific and Eastern Gulf Coasts. The United States needlessly imports about 5.5 million barrels of petroleum each day at an annual cost of $120 billion a year. That kills another 1 million jobs a year in construction, petroleum refining, manufacturing, and professional services.  &#10;&#10;Health benefits costs are about 50 percent higher for U.S. manufacturers than for competitors in Japan and Germany. Obama promised to do something about that too, but the Affordable Care Act mostly subsidizes health coverage for previously uninsured and lower income Americans. Premiums paid by businesses keep rising faster than inflation, further burdening U.S. competitiveness in international markets.  &#10;&#10;High health care costs, coupled with slack in the jobs market, encourage employers to split full time positions into part-time jobs to avoid paying for health insurance and other benefits.  &#10;&#10;Seven million Americans, who want full time employment, are consigned to part- time work—often in retailing and other lower paying service activities, where jobs are more easily divided among several workers.  &#10;&#10;Workers in finance, technology and other high skilled professions are getting good raises, while wages for lower-skilled workers—especially those stuck in part-time positions—lag inflation.  &#10;&#10;Combined with the shortage of mid-skilled jobs in construction and manufacturing, those forces have driven down median family income to $52,120 from about $56,436 prior to the recession. Families near the top have registered significant gains, while the majority of families have permanently lost much more buying power than those averages indicate.  &#10;&#10;Getting America working and incomes rising again requires better managing globalization, freeing up U.S. energy production and smarter, lower-cost business regulations.  &#10;&#10;Without pro-growth policies, the monthly jobs report will continue to bring depressing news to America’s working families and lots of deceptive media hype from White House.  	President Obama has failed recovery effort has simply not delivered enough&#10;good paying, full time jobs.&#10;&#10;

I want to see Leslie McSpadden, Michael Brown’s mother there tonight, and a relative of Tasha Thomas, John Crawford’s now-deceased girlfriend, who was interrogated by the same police department who’d just killed the father of her children for shopping at Wal Mart. Let America look upon the elder Michael Brown, Kadiatou Diallo (Amadou Diallo’s mother), Constance Malcolm (Ramarley Graham’s mother), Sylvia Palmer (Akai Gurley’s mother) or any of the thousands of relatives of the 1,100 or so Americans killed by police in 2014.  &#10;&#10;This of course will never happen, but it’s what I want.  &#10;&#10;President Obama should use the political theatre of his “Skutniks” – the humans used to give a face to presidential pet problems since Ronald Reagan invited Lenny Skutnik to the State of the Union in 1982 – to focus American’s attention squarely on the loss of human life when cops kill black civilians. If President Obama wants us to believe that he thinks black life matters, it’s not enough for him to form a task force on 21 century policing: task forces and commissions are where serious reforms go to be forgotten.  &#10;&#10;One police shooting victim’s family member up in his box with a nice cop like Richmond, California Police Chief Chris Magnus (who famously held up a #BlackLivesMatters sign) is not enough. We don’t need a black kid-white cop hug moment. When the President paired up a black victim of racism with kindly white folks at his “beer summit” in 2009 it was a disaster – at best a distraction, and at worst a prevarication that racism is anecdotal and not systematic.  &#10;&#10;If President Obama is serious about showing black and brown life matters in this country – he’s made some progress showing this overseas by winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, though not so much by employing drone warfare in Pakistan – he needs to go big at the State of the Union. He’s taken on black lives falling victim to gun violence at his annual address before by inviting the parents of Hidaya Pendleton, a black Chicago teenager who was killed in 2013 shortly after performing at Obama’s second inaugural. But as Commander in Chief, with all those black folks at his side, Obama could challenge the mortal violence the state itself wages against its citizens through the local police and say to them: Enough.  &#10;&#10;Ronald Reagan, whom Barack Obama uses as an example for how to sell himself as president, used Lenny Skutnik as an example of how “we saw again the spirit of American heroism at its finest,” after Skutnik jumped into icy water of the Potomac River to help the drowning after a plane crash. But are not the kin of those killed by police violence also displaying “American heroism at its finest” in helping those who can’t breathe?  &#10;&#10;It is women like Tawanda Jones who are creating a more perfect union when she boldly speaks out about her brother being killed by police – even when dissent is under attack and Fox News broadcasts lies about her. When Erica Garner visits the site where two NYPD cops were killed to offer her condolences, she is saving the union. Every time a woman like Michael Brown’s mother calls for non-violence – when she could instead, understandably, lash out with a fraction of the hatred which killed her son – she is keeping the nation from ripping itself apart and acting with the kind of American heroism that presidents should applaud loudly and publicly.  &#10;&#10;Skutnik helped save one woman. The black women who bury their sons and husbands and seek to change the systems that caused their deaths may save countless of lives – and maybe even the soul of the nation.  &#10;&#10;The Black Lives Matters movement is a testament that, once again, black Americans are being called upon to force all Americans to examine our addiction to the violence and militarism that oppresses everyone in different ways. Our first black president, riding an 18 month approval rating high, could choose to do some of that himself tonight, by acknowledging those left behind when black lives are ended by the state and who still choose to use their grief to effect positive change.

(AP Photo/Mandel Ngan, Pool)  &#10;&#10;Here’s a prediction: expect a narrative to emerge in certain media outlets in the coming days that Tuesday night’s State of the Union speech was a grand return to form for President Obama.  &#10;&#10;The elite, east-coast intelligencia line will be that the beleaguered lame duck president—facing a hostile, conservative Congress—regained his momentum with renewed energy and purpose. How Obama Got His Groove Back, Washington- style.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Groove aside, the fact remains that Obama’s next-to-last State of the Union address did not substantially address two of the most pressing issues currently facing our nation and that matter most to its military veterans: the lack of a clear United States national security strategy—to include the crisis facing our military—and the inability of the VA bureaucracy care to deliver timely health care to millions of our veterans.  &#10;&#10;But you wouldn’t know it by listening to Tuesday night’s State of the Union address.  &#10;&#10;President Obama is living in a fantasy world. The president says that we’re “stopping ISIL’s advance.” But in reality, his campaign of airstrikes have not been successful, and ISIS controls more territory in Iraq and Syria today than ever before.  &#10;&#10;He also boldly claimed that “we’re slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need,” but this statement too just doesn’t match up with reality. Today, nearly 250,000 veterans are still stuck in the VA claims backlog and another 290,000 languish in the appeals process. Is that still “too many,” Mr. President?  &#10;&#10;Unfortunate events will likely force the president’s attention to these issues in 2015—just like ISIS did in Iraq and Phoenix did for the VA in 2014. However, President Obama could be proactive and get ahead of these issues by pursuing the following four agenda items:  &#10;&#10;1\. Articulate a real national security strategy. The president’s plan for “leading from behind”—and that national security and foreign policy boils down to “don’t do stupid stuff”—is no substitute for a real strategy, as deteriorating situations in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Ukraine and elsewhere prove. Likewise, denying the nature of the enemy we face (“ISIS is not Islamic”) only muddies the water further, emboldening our enemies and confusing our allies.  &#10;&#10;President Obama also touted ending the 14 year-long war in Afghanistan, but “ending” is different than “winning.” His telegraphed withdrawals have pulled us out of conflicts before they\'re resolved, creating power vacuums in Iraq – and soon in Afghanistan – that leave America more vulnerable. And incredibly, for the first time since 9/11, the president failed to even mention the Taliban or Al Qaeda – both of which are far from “on the run” as he proclaimed in 2012 and are advancing and actively challenging the West.  &#10;&#10;2\. Get serious about fixing defense spending. Instead of cutting fat, the president’s ill-conceived defense budget sequester has slashed into the muscle of our military force. The administration should strive to replace defense sequestration, by implementing serious and commensurate acquisitions and compensation reforms. Reforming these areas will reduce Pentagon budgetary pressures caused by massive weapons system cost-overruns and exploding personnel costs, allowing for a more strategic allocation of war-fighting resources. In order to live within a fiscally responsible reality, and most importantly maintain the world’s most capable military, the administration and Congress must get serious about real DoD spending reform. His address last night didn’t even mention sequestration.  &#10;&#10;3\. Develop and implement a plan to tackle the national debt. Respected military leaders like Marine General James Mattis, Admiral Mike Mullen, and many others recognize that the biggest long-term threat to our national security is our massive national debt.  &#10;&#10;At more than $18 trillion and growing, the debt is on track to double under President Obama. It is absolutely vital to the fiscal, economic, and military strength of our country that we have a serious plan to get our debt under control through reductions in spending and significant reforms across the government.  &#10;&#10;4\. Implement more accountability and choice at the VA. The VA reforms passed by Congress last year were a good first step, but will not address the deeper, systemic culture problems at VA. In the next Congress, the president should champion even deeper reforms at VA to bring accountability for poor performing employees throughout the department and to expand health care options for veterans outside the VA system. These basic principles would not only address a campaign promise the president has failed to deliver on (“fixing the VA”) but would show that he is finally serious about improving veterans’ access to the quality health care they earned.  &#10;&#10;What the president misses, and even defies, in his latest list of proposals is that Americans don’t think government isn’t doing enough. They think government does too much, that most of what it does, it does poorly, and that it doesn’t attend to the issues that matter to them. Focusing on the four agenda items above would send a message that the president is finally serious about governing in his last two years in office.  &#10;&#10;It’s probably too much to ask for Obama to change his approach at this stage in his presidency—but it’s essential if he wants to avoid a legacy of division, defiance and neglect. And if the president continues on his current course? Well, the items listed above will become part of a compelling agenda for his potential successors as they take to the campaign trail for 2016.  	President Obama’s next-to-last State of the Union address did not&#10;substantially address two of the most pressing issues currently facing our&#10;nation: the lack of a clear United States national security strategy and the&#10;inability of the VA bureaucracy care to deliver timely health care to millions&#10;of our veterans.&#10;&#10;

(AP)  &#10;&#10;FILE -- June 3, 2013: Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton speaks on stage during the 2013 CFDA Fashion Awards at Alice Tully Hall in New York. (Photo by Brad Barket/Invision/AP)  &#10;&#10;Is President Obama trying to sabotage Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential run? That’s one take-away from his feisty State of the Union address, in which Mr. Obama did three things: first, he moved the Democratic agenda far to the left, where Hillary is not entirely comfortable; second, he rebuffed the clear preference of voters that he work with Congress, by making the cornerstone of his address proposals unacceptable to the GOP and third, he assured the country that our foreign policy (Hillary’s foreign policy) is working.  &#10;&#10;Americans are not at all convinced, 13 days after the vicious attacks on Charlie Hedbo in Paris, that Obama’s “broader strategy” is leading to “a safer, more prosperous world.” Obama says he believes in a “smarter kind of American leadership”; for many in the country, the assertion borders on arrogance.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;None of these messages works for Hillary.  &#10;&#10;Mr. Obama’s focus on the middle class is unsurprising. Lagging income growth for the average American has emerged as the likely debate in 2016, for good reason. The numbers show that during the Obama recovery, the middle class has, as Joe Biden put it, been “left behind.”  &#10;&#10;The issue is valid; Mr. Obama’s progressive approach to helping average Americans – relying on more taxation and more government programs -- is not.  &#10;&#10;Despite Americans listing job creation as their number one concern for the past six years, putting people to work has never been President Obama’s priority. He has not encouraged businesses to hire, either through reducing tax rates on employers or by expanding business opportunities – through trade, or reduced regulations, for instance.  &#10;&#10;On the contrary, his economic prescriptions have raised costs for employers through the onerous provisions of Obamacare and his efforts to raise the minimum wage.  &#10;&#10;As of this SOTU address, he has doubled down, since many of the suggested tax hikes will land on small companies that pay taxes as individuals, and as his proposed sick pay and maternity leave will raise the costs of hiring. Such policies have led to labor participation rates that are still bumping along historical lows, a crisis in our disability program, and stagnant wages. A short course in economics might help the White House: a tighter jobs market will raise wages. The government raising wages will put people out of work. It’s that simple.  &#10;&#10;Obama revisited his familiar theme of making sure all Americans have a “fair shot”; he wants to raise taxes to make sure the rich do “their fair share.” He has never laid out what that share should be, but he has tried hard to convince Americans that the wealthy don’t play “by the same set of rules.”  &#10;&#10;It’s a tired song, and Americans have never bought the program.  &#10;&#10;A recent Rasmussen poll showed that 60% of Americans think the country is “fair” and “decent.” They don’t believe that income distribution is the answer. They believe in growth, in optimism, in everyone getting ahead.  &#10;&#10;The tax proposals outlined by President Obama are old school, and dead on arrival in the Republican Congress, as he well knows. Congress has indicated an eagerness to work with the president on tax reform, but has prioritized changing the dysfunctional corporate tax code.  &#10;&#10;The president understands that by placing individual tax hikes first in the queue, he has just undermined any chance for bipartisan agreement. And, by adopting the priorities of the left, which emphasize wealth redistribution and also embrace further exploiting the financial sector, he is drafting behind liberal icon Senator Elizabeth Warren.  &#10;&#10;This is a slap at Hillary, for two reasons. First, Hillary is unquestionably uncomfortable putting on a progressive cloak.  &#10;&#10;In the fall campaigns she awkwardly mimicked Liz Warren’s rhetoric, embarrassing herself with the head-scratcher “Don’t let anyone tell you that it’s businesses and corporations that create jobs.”  &#10;&#10;Hillary is a successful, wealthy woman who pretends otherwise and stubs her toe on money issues, such as when she described herself and her husband as “dead broke” upon leaving the White House. Also, Hillary has difficulty distancing herself from Wall Street; the Wall Street Journal has reported that she and her husband have raised nearly $5 million from Goldman Sachs alone.  &#10;&#10;It’s also awkward for Mrs. Clinton that the president has burned relations with Republicans…again. In his speech, while talking about “A better politics” in which “we debate without demonizing each other,” the president also threatened to veto a number of GOP initiatives.  &#10;&#10;Voters have shown they want the government to function – to repair our infrastructure, reform our dreadful tax code, to compete more effectively with our trading rivals, to streamline our outdated government agencies.  &#10;&#10;For six years Mr. Obama has blamed the GOP for standing in the way of his programs; now he will be the obstructer-in-chief. From his State of the Union address, it is clear that he is not interested in partnering with Republicans. His aggressive executive actions over the past several weeks on preventing deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants and unilaterally overhauling our Cuba policy were the tip of the iceberg. Mr. Obama is not into compromise.  &#10;&#10;Voters do not like the president’s “go it alone” program; they understand why the nation’s founders included those pesky checks and balances. Obama will make it more difficult for any Democrat trying to succeed him to convince voters that he or she will “work across the aisle” – a claim that Hillary might actually credibly make.  &#10;&#10;Finally, Obama’s insufficient resolve against the threat of Islamic terrorism, and conviction that his efforts overseas are bearing fruit, are alarming. Like Muggles fearful of naming the fearsome Voldemort, Obama seems to think if he just doesn’t say “Islamic terrorism” out loud, the menace will pass him by.  &#10;&#10;His embarrassing absence in Paris, his waffle on Syria, his underestimation of ISIS – it all speaks to his pretense that we have won the War on Terror.  &#10;&#10;That our president can be so misled and so misleading on a matter of such grave importance is horrifying. That Hillary Clinton was the enabler of his clueless foreign policy is a serious problem for the former first lady. And, for the country, should she be elected.  &#10;&#10;  	Is President Obama trying to sabotage Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential run?&#10;&#10;
183-observereditorialparisattackst	guardian	2015-01-11T09:43:41Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/11/observer-editorial-paris-attacks-terror-we-must-unite-against-division	Observer editorial	The Observer view on the Paris attacks	Last week’s attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris and the subsequent, linked hostage-taking at a Jewish supermarket were appalling acts of inhumanity that should be universally condemned. Despite the killers’ grandiose claim to be “defenders of the prophet”, their actions amounted to cold-blooded murder of defenceless people. Their pre-planned purpose was to terrorise, divide and dismay. Their aim was cowardly, contemptible and cruel. The perpetrators deserve only ignominy and the bitter scorn of the world.  &#10;&#10;The attacks should be understood, more broadly, as a crude attempt to stifle a publication and its journalists who exercised, in vivid, unapologetic terms, the fundamental, priceless right to freedom of speech and expression. This right, though never absolute, was established through centuries of struggle and is still far from fully accepted around the world. There are many others – governments, dictators, religious fanatics – who would also like to shoot it down. That the killers’ made Jews their additional, parallel target lends a woefully familiar, disgustingly antisemitic twist to a three-day trail of carnage and grief. By so doing, they hoped yet another community would be left in fear.  &#10;&#10;This attack was thus also an attack on the French nation as a whole, on the values and beliefs that have sustained it, and on the message of liberty, equality and fraternity it has unevenly but persistently propagated. And while its principal victims were irreverent secularists, it was also an attack on faith – an offence against moral as well as human law. It was an attack on the life spiritual itself, whether conducted through church, mosque, synagogue or personal observance. It was an act of utter godlessness.  &#10;&#10;By attempting to murder love with fear, to kill laughter with hatred, to substitute inflexible dogmas for shared truths, the masked gunmen attacked us all, European, American and Arab, Muslim, Christian and Jew, black, brown and white alike. In doing so, they posed a vital question. How, in the face of this assault on our common home, our common humanity, do we respond? Do we meet terror with a greater terror of our own or do we seek another way? Shall we unite together or shall we give in to division, discrimination and distrust?  &#10;&#10;In Paris, and in other cities around the world, a spontaneous reply has already been given. The marchers, demonstrators, office workers, journalists, bloggers, politicians and governments who declared, with one voice: “Je suis Charlie”, sent an immediate, welcome message of solidarity and defiance. Today, this roar of courage and belief will reach ear-splitting levels when people from every background join a march in Paris for unity, freedom and democracy. Out of blood and horror a unique moment has arisen, for France and all Europe. The choice is stark and unavoidable. It is between the ongoing struggle for enlightenment – Europe’s gift to the world – and a gathering, hate-filled darkness.  &#10;&#10;The evident danger is that this spirit of unity may not endure. French Muslim leaders have roundly condemned the attackers. “These men are criminals… For me, they are not Muslims,” said the imam of Drancy. But at less emotional moments, French Muslims also speak of routine, entrenched discrimination, of insensitive restrictions such as curbs on women wearing the veil, and of a French policy of assimilation and integration, the flipside of Britain’s let- it-all-hang-out multiculturalism, which has failed to achieve equal rights and equal treatment. It is this same embattled Muslim community, fractured, underprivileged, marginalised and disrespected which produced the killers.  &#10;&#10;It is clear, conversely, that many French people have a problem with Islam. According to an Ipsos survey last year, 63% of French voters said Islam was not compatible with French values. Almost three-quarters said Muslims wanted to impose their values on others. Surveys also suggest seven out of 10 voters believe sections of the immigrant community have failed to integrate over the past 30 years. Some 65% say immigration levels are out of control.  &#10;&#10;Anti-Muslim and anti-immigration movements are growing in strength in Germany, Britain and across Europe. But France’s already powerful far-right Front National is certain to use the Charlie Hebdo affair to exploit these fears and prejudices. The urgent, daunting challenge for President François Hollande’s ruling socialists, and the centre-right of former President Nicolas Sarkozy, is to plot a different, more conciliatory path. Their task: to tap into this spirit of unity, forging a new reality for both majority and minority communities.  &#10;&#10;Muslim world leaders can help halt the cycles of violence and confrontation, if they wish. But this common challenge will not be assisted by wrong-headed, kneejerk reactions by western security services. In France, there is justified criticism that the Kouachi brothers were not under close watch, given their past record of extremism. Yet it would be wrong to massively increase monitoring of the Muslim community, thereby exacerbating existing tensions. Much better to use any additional resources to engage, rather than confront, while focusing more exactly on identifying truly hardline fanatics.  &#10;&#10;Similarly, calls for more cash to counter a mounting but undefined terrorist menace to Britain should be treated with both respect and circumspection. Andrew Parker, head of MI5, warned last week of the “growing gap between the increasingly challenging threat and the decreasing availability of capabilities to address it”. But extended, intrusive internet surveillance does not necessarily bring increased security. What it does do is potentially deal a further blow to personal liberty, including the ability to speak and communicate freely and openly.  &#10;&#10;The response to the Charlie Hebdo killings, in the longer term, should also include wider acceptance of the proper limits to individual and social freedoms, including free speech. It is not acceptable, for example, to use racist terms to describe a different ethnic group. It is not acceptable to resort to stereotypes to vilify minorities or, say, members of the opposite sex. And it is sometimes not appropriate, nor particularly funny, to deliberately provoke Muslims by publishing cartoons of the prophet that they view as blasphemous, offensive and insulting.  &#10;&#10;Having said that, individuals or groups should not seek to prevent or ban published material just because they do not like it, do not agree or do not get the joke. Even more so, the ridiculing of Islam, however much resented, cannot be used to justify or explain gross acts of violence. The freedom to speak, write, draw and laugh fearlessly, without censorship and unreasonable restraint, lies at the very heart of a tolerant, democratic and inclusive society.

184-observerviewhealthandsugarpedd	guardian	2015-01-18T00:04:06Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/18/observer-view-health-and-sugar-peddling-food-industry-	Observer editorial	The Observer view on our health and the sugar-peddling food industry	The London Eye, a landmark since the Millennium, welcomed the first day of a new sponsor yesterday. Coca-Cola plans to play “an even greater part in future moments of happiness and celebration in the capital”, according to Jon Woods, general manager of Coca-Cola UK and Ireland. It’s ironic that the arrival of the red and white trademark colours of a global drink renowned, in its original form, for providing a shocking nine spoonfuls of sugar per 330ml can, comes at the end of a week in which, as in every week, 500 children received hospital treatment for dental decay, and there have been a stream of warnings about the health of the nation. We are swallowing far more sugar, salt and fat than is good for us – or the public purse.  &#10;&#10;One warning came last Thursday when On Rock or Sand: Firm Foundations for Britain’s Future was published, edited by John Sentamu, archbishop of York. It tackles a range of issues spawned by a low-wage economy and refers to the current epidemic of obesity that, for the first time in many decades, means that some children may live shorter lives than their parents. On Rock or Sand rightly points out that “choice” in diet is complex. It is influenced by income, class, culture and societal pressure among myriad other drivers, not least the seductive practices of the marketplace in disguising what goes into processed food and employing the hard sell in honeyed words that are particularly effective on children.  &#10;&#10;Low-cost food and medical progress have ensured longer lives but decades with a long-term condition can also bring misery. The book quotes Department of Health figures that show 62% of adults and 28% of children are overweight or obese. The health problems this spawns include type 2 diabetes, cancer and heart disease, between them costing NHS England more than £5bn a year.  &#10;&#10;Last Wednesday, Andy Burnham, Labour shadow health secretary, launched Labour’s public health strategy. It served up even scarier statistics. Unless the rise in obesity is reversed, the cost to the NHS of diabetes alone will rise from £10bn a year to an unsustainable £17bn a year by 2035. While the World Health Organisation recommends that 5% of our food energy should come from sugar, children are consuming triple that amount. Further bad news came from the Youth Sport Trust, in its Unlocking Potential report. Only 21% of boys and 16% of girls are exercising sufficiently. Physical education lessons have slumped below the miserly two hours a week set by the previous Labour government. The trust is rightly calling for five hours of physical activity a week in state schools to match that offered by private schools. Eating too much and doing too little may be a personal “choice” for some, but it’s one the nation can ill-afford. So what’s to be done?  &#10;&#10;The first is to show common sense. It is incredible that Merlin Entertainments should consider Coca-Cola a suitable sponsor for the London Eye. As this paper reports, John Middleton, vice-president of the UK Faculty of Public Health, says: “Coca-Cola is the flagship for sugar marketing and therefore the flagship for rotten teeth and diabetes.” The second imperative is for government to wake up to the scale of the health disaster on its doorstep. In February 2010, David Cameron laid out his vision for “a new age of government”. “If you combine this very simple, very conservative thought – go with the grain of human nature – with all the advances in behavioural economics,” he said, “I think we can achieve a real increase in wellbeing… without necessarily having to spend a lot of money.” Money has certainly been tight even as public health issues, supporting improved wellbeing, have disastrously dropped off the agenda, issues such as plain packages for cigarettes, minimum pricing on alcohol and an end to selling sports fields. In 2013-14, the NHS budget was over £95bn, compared with only £1.8 bn allocated to Public Health England to promote “wellness”.  &#10;&#10;The lack of investment in prevention, married to politicians’ fear of the charge of “uber-interference” and “the nanny state”, means that multinationals have too little restraint. We accept the so-called nanny state edicts on seat belts, smoking and drink, so why can’t the state take a much greater role in improving the food that is sold to us and marketed to our children?  &#10;&#10;Andy Burnham calls this “finger wagging”. On the contrary, it is lifesaving. It is welcome that Burnham has promised that Labour will legislate to reduce the sugar, fat and salt in foods sold to children. Such steps require rigour in the face of food industry claims that it’s difficult to differentiate between “family foods”. The “responsibility deal” in which businesses voluntarily take action to improve public health hasn’t produced many results. Last week, for instance, Asda promised to reduce 22% of added sugar in some 26 of its own brand drinks, amounting to a reduction of a staggering 3.25bn calories. However, Professor Graham MacGregor of Action on Sugar says that only reveals the scale of what remains to be done. Little bits of action are no substitute for sugar reduction mandated by government policy. As Burnham correctly said last week: “For change to work in a market context, all players need to be following the same rules.”  &#10;&#10;Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer, has warned that a 20% tax on sugar in fizzy drinks may be required. It makes sense. Advertising to children is another issue requiring intervention. Promoting unhealthy products is restricted on children’s television but it is unfettered online in “advergames” and between 8pm and 9pm on television when, according to Malcolm Clark of the lobbying group, the Children’s Food Campaign (CFC), ads are a junk food paradise. Burnham intends to ask the committee on advertising practice and the Advertising Standards Authority how children can be better protected. That is a cop-out. The CFC, backed by the British Heart Foundation, has rightly proposed a body independent from the advertising industry to monitor and regulate marketing to children and tougher enforcements.  &#10;&#10;Managing diet, taking exercise and aiming for fitness can’t be directly stipulated in law. Parents, government, the community and the commercial sector all play a part in taking responsibility. However, the balance of power is skewed against the ordinary citizen, particularly those penalised by profound health inequalities, and towards those with profit in mind. The state has to play a far more dynamic role than Labour envisages or the coalition provides, to ensure that what does us good, at a price we can afford, becomes the established framework for a healthy life.

185-observerviewontvpoliticaldebat	guardian	2015-01-11T00:04:55Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/11/observer-view-on-tv-political-debate	Observer editorial	The Observer view on the TV election debate	Has there ever been so much debate about a debate? The negotiations about this year’s TV leader’s debates sank to a new low last week, with David Cameron appearing to use the fact that the Greens now look likely to be excluded as an opportunity to bow out.  &#10;&#10;Far from a principled stance, this came across as a self-serving attempt to get out of jail free, following as it did in the wake of his equivocation about whether he would participate in the debates he once so enthusiastically embraced as challenger rather than incumbent. Cameron’s decision to pull out of an online video debate for first-time voters also reflects poorly on his motives. Surely if he really wanted the Greens involved he would have co- ordinated a call from all three party leaders to the broadcasters to include them in the debates? In the face of such cross-party consensus it would have been unthinkable for them to refuse.  &#10;&#10;It is a damning indictment that the political parties cannot even agree on a format for a series of election debates. One has to question where that leaves the real challenges facing the country that will require a degree of cross- party consensus to tackle over the next decade, in a time when increasing political instability looks set to be the norm. Long-term reform of the NHS and care systems to cope with an ageing population or restructuring the banks to insulate us against another financial crisis are issues far more complex and thorny than a debate format.  &#10;&#10;This episode reveals two further truths. First, all our leaders have claimed to want to change the nature of the conversation between politicians and voters. But too often these claims are undermined. Ed Miliband argued for a new politics in July 2014, shunning the shallowness of husky-themed photo-ops. He launched his election campaign with a promise Labour activists will engage in four million conversations, talking to people on doorsteps rather than communicating using poster campaigns. But the authenticity of this has been undercut by Labour’s continued reliance on negative campaigning, including their election broadcast ridiculing Nick Clegg as the “Un-Credible Shrinking Man” who has abandoned his principles, and leaked strategy documents telling candidates to move on when voters raise immigration as an issue.  &#10;&#10;Cameron’s attempt to extract himself from debates that attracted tens of millions of viewers in the run-up to the last election undermines these claims by the political class even further. It smacks of politicians only interested in pursuing a new style of politics when it suits their strategy.  &#10;&#10;Second, the disagreement around the debates is a symptom of the extent to which Britain’s two-party majoritarian system is breaking down. The vote share of the two main parties has steadily declined in recent decades to the extent that it no longer looks as if the two parties will be able to sustain a majority under the current electoral system. We are now in the territory where their declining vote share means first past the post is beginning to deliver what increasingly looks like arbitrary rather than democratically credible outcomes.  &#10;&#10;It is nonsensical for the Greens to be excluded on the basis of their vote share in an electoral system that provides strong disincentives to vote for them in the first place. Hundreds of thousands of people have signed a petition for them to be included and eight in 10 voters think they should take part. Ofcom’s decision that they don’t have sufficient support to accord them “major party status” and the broadcasters’ reluctance to invite them to participate have the ring of a political establishment desperately trying to cling on to the cartel-like status quo.  &#10;&#10;A political rulebook that better reflects the more pluralistic politics developing in Britain would do more than any speech or campaign to facilitate a more honest, authentic conversation with the public. Cameron’s attempt to wriggle out of the debates is shameful and he must accept the invitation issued by the Guardian, Telegraph and YouTube to take part in an online debate including the Greens. But he should be doing much more: he should be leading a national conversation involving all the party leaders about how the pluralism of the electorate can be represented in a more democratic system of politics. The longer the main parties try to resist, the more disillusioned and disenfranchised the public will become.

186-onelawforpolanskianotherforche	guardian	2015-01-11T09:41:07Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/11/one-law-for-polanski-another-for-ched-evans	Catherine Bennett	Seems there’s one law for Roman Polanski. Another for Ched Evans	Maybe it’s inevitable, now that Julian Assange, has spent almost 1,500 days in the bowels of the Ecuadorian embassy, that memories of how he came to be in there grow ever more hazy. With a forgetfulness that, if genuine, demonstrates how rapidly the most preposterous inventions can acquire the status of fact, even his colleagues at WikiLeaks have convinced themselves that Assange was incarcerated by a British government determined to keep him quiet.  &#10;&#10;Among the more opportunistic tweets responding to the massacre in Paris, came this, from the WikiLeaks account: “David Cameron pontificates about freedom of speech while spending millions detaining #Assange without trial.” At this impressive rate of fabulation, the 2,000th day should see our unhappy visionary gagged in a dripping cell as he awaits the death sentence applied to all fugitives who dare speak freely in the Kafkaesque nightmare that is 21st- century Britain. It would bear as much relation to the facts, after all, as the current myth of his forced detention without trial.  &#10;&#10;So, to recap: in June 2012, Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, was in the UK, free to speak on any subject he liked, and fighting extradition from Britain to Sweden, where he faced allegations of sexual assaults on two women. Preferring to break his bail conditions rather than clear his name in Sweden, he sought asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy, where he remains to this day. It is a source of consternation, at least outside his support base, that the cost of policing the embassy so as to enforce the legal process should Assange ever emerge, has now exceeded £9m. Last November, an arrest warrant for Assange was upheld in a Swedish court.  &#10;&#10;In short, #Assange is not “detained” by anyone or anything other than his own reluctance to face questioning about alleged sex offences, in a country where extradition to the US is no more likely than it is here. But maybe this confusion about his journey from free-speech celebrity to pallid hermit helps one understand why Assange, though accused of sex offences, has survived much of the public opprobrium, internet gossip and suspicion that dogs other individuals associated with accusations of sexual misconduct, such as the harassment expert Julien Blanc or the Lib Dem octopus, Lord Rennard.  &#10;&#10;To the contrary. On the website where a petition denounces the footballer and convicted rapist Ched Evans, thousands demand the Nobel prize, along with freedom and protection, for Assange; his admirers even attempted to kickstart funds for a statue, honouring the man who has portrayed his Swedish accusers as instruments in a smear campaign. Other analysts, however, have detected enough evidence of female self-determination to attribute the women’s hostility to everything from sexual jealousy to a bad case of radical feminism.  &#10;&#10;Clearly, Assange’s better-informed supporters, who include celebrities such as Lady Gaga, Arundhati Roy and Vivienne Westwood, will be aware of the Swedish allegations and have chosen, for one reason or another, to set them aside. A similar immunity seems to have been conferred on Prince Andrew, following allegations of his sexual impropriety with a minor who worked for his American friend, a convicted paedophile. Though “emphatically denied”, with the extra benefit of a character reference from Andrew’s ex-wife, who was lent money by the paedophile, there has been no announcement of the type of legal manoeuvre that the similarly accused Alan Dershowitz is pursuing after allegations that he also took sexual advantage of the 17-year-old.  &#10;&#10;Yet Andrew, too, has so far escaped a petition objecting to him “assisting the economic success of our United Kingdom”, as the palace describes his various holidays. Perhaps, as happened to the creepy Blanc when he attempted to visit the UK, some other country would be good enough to help out with a banning order.  &#10;&#10;If the difference between unproven allegations and, in Ched Evans’s case, a formal conviction, can satisfactorily explain this variability in public tolerance, the footballer’s supporters are surely entitled to compare his treatment unfavourably with, for example, that of Roman Polanski. Why have opponents of Evans’s return to football, now or ever, not shown similar concern about the film director’s rehabilitation? Polanski’s return to Poland, for filming, has just prompted another US extradition request, that he be returned to face sentencing pending since 1978, when he admitted unlawful sex with a 13-year-old.  &#10;&#10;It must help, of course, that successful film directors have not been classified, by whichever national committee rules on fitness for role- modelling, as officially inspirational. Polanski, like his colleague Woody Allen, who embarked, in his mid-50s, on an affair with his partner’s 19-year- old daughter, sister to three of his children, cannot be accused of betraying impressionable fans, those millions of starstruck kiddies whose wee moral compasses are left spinning wildly when their idols fall short.  &#10;&#10;That responsibility is still monopolised, as repeatedly confirmed in ongoing Evans analysis, by the profession that is, for many of us, more strongly associated than any other – no disrespect to full-time pimps or Sun newspaper editors – with vulgarity, aggression, racism, irresponsibility and contempt for women.  &#10;&#10;The Professional Footballers’ Association’s Gordon Taylor’s casual analogy between the plight of Evans, the convicted rapist, and that of the bereaved Hillsborough families only confirms that the profession that gave us Rooney’s “auld slapper”, Sky Sport’s “did you smash it”, and, yet more recently, the Premier League Richard Scudamore’s “big-titted broads” work-account remains institutionally unworthy of redemption, at least where women are concerned. Maybe it is not irrationally high expectations of football’s young ambassadors, so much as an evidence-based recoil from its culture, that has fuelled a special implacability towards Ched Evans, to the point of closing down his career.  &#10;&#10;His only hope of eventual re-employment in football, at this point, is not, surely, his future father-in-law’s website, but either a) an open letter from Naomi Wolf, feminist and champion of Julian Assange, or b) an appearance by Whoopi Goldberg protesting that Evans’s was not “rape-rape”.  &#10;&#10;Polanski also benefited from extensive celebrity support, including, when he was arrested in Switzerland in 2009, a petition for his release signed by, among the British luminaries, Salman Rushdie, Sam Mendes, Stephen Frears, Terry Gilliam, Jeremy Irons, Emma Thompson and Tilda Swinton. Everyone in international film-making, they said, wanted Polanksi “to know that he has their support and friendship”.  &#10;&#10;Perhaps there should be one law for acclaimed intellectuals and another for men such as Ched Evans? But if not, the latter must have at least as good a case as Polanski for re-employment, once he has completed his sentence.  &#10;&#10;Alternatively, if a serious sex conviction should cost a footballer his entire career (along with the professions routinely closed to sex offenders) then a similar vigilance should, surely, be applied to discernible sleazebaggery in any other profession, from whistleblowing to royal work, where clemency might be mistaken for approval.  	Catherine Bennett: ‘Polite society’ is fickle in how it views sex offences. If a footballer can’t go back to work, why can a director?

I myself am an occasional sufferer.  &#10;&#10;It’s simply the delirium in the air. Just as patients can fall in love with their psychoanalysts, so movie journalists can take these prizes very personally. Critics who are so airily humorous and drily detached the rest of the year will sternly announce that they are actually pretty angry or upset that their personal favourite hasn’t been nominated. They will undergo a radical personality change.  &#10;&#10;Having steadfastly refused to as much as sip the Kool-Aid for the preceding 12 months, they suddenly glug down about a gallon of it in five minutes and effectively proclaim their deep personal stake in what happens on Oscar night.  &#10;&#10;And what is seen as good news produces even more extraordinary behaviour: a kind of luvvyism-by-proxy. Actual grownup journalists with mortgages and adult responsibilities will coo: “I’m just so delighted for Meryl …” or “I’m so happy for Emily …”  &#10;&#10;Did these starstruck reporters meet the celebs briefly at some press junket or interview? Did these stars convince these poor unfamous journalists that they were their mates? I fear so. And they are therefore brilliant actors, and deserve every Oscar going.  &#10;&#10;Confectionery lovers are enraged at news that the US owners of Cadbury have been tampering with the recipe for the Cadbury’s Creme Egg, and at what they say is an outrageous lack of any consultative process with the consumer. The shell is no longer made from Cadbury’s Dairy Milk but from the inferior “standard cocoa mix”.  &#10;&#10;This insidious messing with its components could provoke an Indian mutiny among Creme Egg lovers. Surely we need one of those change.org online petitions. I personally have never quite got over my childhood suspicion that the spelling “creme” means that the Creme Egg is not in fact made of actual cream. But I have been prepared to put these considerations to one side in the cause of continued snacking.  &#10;&#10;For me, however, this is not the worst snack-related catastrophe imaginable. If Pringles started tinkering with the recipe for their Sour Cream & Onion flavour, that would be appalling. If, for example, they started using a kind of artificial “creme” instead of “cream”, and introduced some form of artificial substitute instead of actual onions … Unthinkable.  &#10;&#10;There are new and interesting reasons to relish the imminent release of Paul Thomas Anderson’s fascinating film Inherent Vice, based on Thomas Pynchon’s novel of the same name: a quasi-noir about a bleary stoner private detective on the trail of his ex-girlfriend’s kidnapped lover. It is set in Los Angeles in 1970, and its black-comic tone of paranoia is crucially set by the horrendous killings carried out in that era by the Charles Manson gang.  &#10;&#10;Manson passionately wanted those killings to trigger an apocalyptic race war, and was every bit as serious about his ideological vision as the Charlie Hebdo murderers were about theirs – and as an American political issue, racial tension was and is real enough. But of course no one took Charlie Manson seriously as a revolutionary warrior. And Thomas Pynchon and Paul Thomas Anderson find the right register to respond: with comedy, scorn and a resilient and healthy sense of surreality and the absurd that, however dark, absorbs and transcends hate.  &#10;&#10;@PeterBradshaw1  	Peter Bradshaw: Just as patients can fall in love with their psychoanalysts, so movie journalists can take these prizes to heart
188-ouruniversitiesmustadaptmodern	guardian	2015-01-11T11:42:55Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/11/our-universities-must-adapt-modern-world	Sonia Sodha	It's time to reinvent what universities can be	With the annual Ucas university application deadline looming on Thursday, thousands of 17-year-olds will be putting the finishing touches to their personal statements. And so another cycle of conditional offers, A-level results and nervous forays into freshers’ week begins.  &#10;&#10;Unlike 50 years ago, when a tiny, socially elite proportion went to university, they will be joining almost 50% of their peers in studying for a degree, facing average costs of upwards of £46k for a three-year degree, including tuition and living costs, compared with the generous grants available up until the 1990s.  &#10;&#10;Setting expansion aside, it is remarkable how much hasn’t changed: at the heart of the system remains a core model of young people moving away to university to study for three-year full-time degrees; an expensive route for which they now bear much of the costs themselves. Yet the jobs market has changed beyond recognition. Graduates are now responsible for forging their own careers in a fluid market compared with the jobs for life that were the norm a few decades ago and employers are demanding a completely different set of skills. Does this model, then, remain fit for purpose?  &#10;&#10;The political debate has focused on fee levels and headline prices to the exclusion of almost everything else, including the benefits and value of a university education – and how they might be improved. The debate about whether the 50% participation target is too high has been similarly staid: surely it’s a no-brainer to hope that at least half of young people engage in advanced learning. But what type of learning should that be?  &#10;&#10;One of the purported benefits of marketising higher education was that the market itself would deliver innovation and better value. But the government massively overegged the potential for higher education to behave like a market. Student demand far exceeds supply of places and price has become a proxy for quality. Little wonder, then, that average fees are far higher than the £6,000 a year that the then universities minister, David Willetts, predicted when he introduced the £9,000 fee cap.  &#10;&#10;We now have the nonsense of a market where students pay the same for very different amounts and quality of academic provision. This is reflected in the variation in students’ own perceptions: research by the consumer body Which? found almost a third of first-year undergraduates thought their course was poor value for money, while less than half thought seminars were worth attending.  &#10;&#10;There is too little accountability for this variation within the powerful sector: universities award their own degrees; the sector is opaque, even resisting moves to publish comparable information on the amount of teaching students can expect for their fees; and the higher education regulator is weak, with virtually no powers to tell universities to buck up standards.  &#10;&#10;The debate about innovation has centred on distance learning and Moocs (Massive Online Open Courses). There is no doubt developments in technology have the potential to transform the way university education is experienced. But it’s pointless to focus on technology at the expense of changes that need to happen in the system in order to take advantage of it. Moocs will not transform the sector until they are embraced by the most prestigious universities: why shouldn’t you be able to study for a cut-price Oxford degree, half via YouTube and Skype, and half among the dreaming spires?  &#10;&#10;Other innovations that could bring down costs without sacrificing quality might be a restructure of the system to standardise first-year curriculums, enabling young people to combine studying for a year or two at their local university with a year or two on campus at a more specialist institution. We could see more professional degrees co-delivered and funded by universities and employers, such as the accountancy degree offered by Durham and KPMG in which young people benefit from six years of combined university and work experience.  &#10;&#10;Or there could be more intensive two-year courses, perhaps aimed at young people getting a year or two of work experience after school. University could be combined with more modern ways of adjusting to adulthood: for example, a year spent in a structured volunteering programme, such as that offered by the charity City Year, offers huge opportunities to develop the grit and teamwork so valued by today’s employers, while making a real contribution to schools and other public services.  &#10;&#10;But on some measures we are moving backwards, with a massive fall in numbers of part-time and mature students in the few years since the £9,000 fee cap was introduced. There are lessons from the 1960s, when Harold Wilson’s government realised that the only way to increase access in the face of a reluctant sector was to back Michael Young’s vision for a new institution, the Open University, which increased the student population by Britain by a fifth when it was launched via its distance learning degrees.  &#10;&#10;Government can’t simply wait for the sector to do what it is asked to do. It needs to foster a conversation with universities, students and employers about what it means to get a degree. Of course there will always be a role for the academic. But should we be shoehorning the majority of undergraduates into this model, or should getting a degree more routinely encompass work experience?  &#10;&#10;It should also introduce strong new accountabilities within the sector. One way of doing this would be to separate degree-awarding powers from learning provision, as suggested by the Social Market Foundation. This would allow new providers to offer innovative ways of meeting the standards set by a Russell Group university, for example. And government should provide more incentives for universities to innovate.  &#10;&#10;Come Friday, many teenagers will be heaving a collective sigh of relief once their applications are in. They deserve the best possible learning experience for the significant time and money they will invest in their degrees: it’s critical we don’t shy away from a challenge to universities to ensure their ivory towers continue to evolve to keep pace with the world around them.

189-page3censorshipsunsexsells	guardian	2015-01-20T20:15:58Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/20/page-3-censorship-sun-sex-sells	Simon Jenkins	Page 3’s demise smacks of censorship	So it’s farewell nipples. They are to vanish – from the Sun’s Page 3. So they will remain online, except in the Daily Star, except in a hundred magazines and a thousand “tasteful” fashion shoots. So what next?  &#10;&#10;Children are already pixelated. What about female (and male) bottoms, singers’ crotch shots, David Beckham’s ill-concealed genitalia or naked female flesh in general? The BBC is awash with nipples after the watershed, so is the stage, the cinema and the art gallery. I am told that some Muslims are offended by scantily clad models that grace the side of buses. They are sexier than Page 3 of the Sun, which is about as arousing as an ankle at a Victorian dance.  &#10;&#10;I hate censorship, even when government considers it vital in the interests of law and order. It is ironic that the Sun’s move should come just weeks after terrorists attempted the most brutal form of censorship in France. Of course no one was planning to murder the Sun and its hapless models, but some campaigners wanted it banned or confined to pornography shelves and starved of advertising. Like millions of Muslims, they claimed Page 3 caused them offence – a “claim” which in English law nowadays is sufficient reason to invoke curbs on freedom of speech.  &#10;&#10;The reason the Sun alone was singled out for such concern is largely that it is owned by Rupert Murdoch (whereas the similar Daily Star is not). But then taste in Britain has always been bound up with class – or, as the protesters say, “context”. No one calls for a ban on bare-breasted Kate Moss or Madonna, but instead applauds them for “being in control”. Protesters have not barracked Covent Garden or the Coliseum for “objectifying” women by depicting orgies on stage. They do not picket Lars von Trier’s films or the Chapman brothers’ galleries.  &#10;&#10;A YouGov survey last year revealed that a full 86% of Guardian readers wanted Page 3 stopped (by whom?), against two thirds of Sun readers who wanted it retained. Sun readers were not invited to suggest offending content for censorship in the Guardian.  &#10;&#10;The truth appears to be that Page 3 has outlived its editorial purpose, which is how it should be. It is not that nudity in public places has become taboo, but that it has become the opposite, ubiquitous and banal. Men’s bodies are now as “objectified” as women’s, on editorial pages and advertisements alike. Sex still sells. For better or worse, most people seem to take the public depiction of sexuality in their stride, and others are having to put up with it.  &#10;&#10;Sometimes we all have to take a deep breath and acknowledge that other people enjoy different things from us, and this may sometimes upset us. But since it gets ever harder – indeed dangerous – to say live and let live, we need to remember the alternative is far more appalling.

Five countries abstained, and two - the US and Australia - voted no.  &#10;&#10;Draft resolutions are usually preceded by consultations with Council members, so whoever submits them knows, beforehand, which way the vote will go. This draft was no different. In fact, insufficient support among Council members was the initial reason given months ago by the PA for a delay in the vote.  &#10;&#10;As such, it must have known prior to presenting the draft that it would fail, so why go through with it?  &#10;&#10;In fact, why did the PA try to push through a resolution in the first place? Even if it mustered the minimum votes, the US would have used its veto, and the PA knew it. Not only have the Americans consistently scuppered any resolution that places even the slightest criticism or pressure on Israel, but Washington had been explicit about its intention to use its veto this time round if necessary.  &#10;&#10;As such, it is puzzling that Jordan's UN Ambassador Dina Kawar, whose country submitted the draft with the backing of the PA and the Arab League, said she thought Council members should have had more time to discuss the proposal.  &#10;&#10;What would be the point in the face of an assured American veto?  &#10;&#10;The only way Washington would acquiesce was if the resolution called for an end to the Palestinian occupation of Israel. This makes PA President Mahmoud Abbas's recent statement that he had repeatedly postponed the resolution due to US pressure equally puzzling.  &#10;&#10;Did he actually think anything he could say or do would lead to the US dropping such pressure, or that it would accept the draft that was presented?  &#10;&#10;In any case, months of consultations and various reasons for delays only resulted in the continued watering down of the text. This led to widespread Palestinian condemnation, from the public and from every faction.  &#10;&#10;Among the most prominent critics is the widely popular senior Fatah figure Marwan Barghouti, whose party dominates the PA and includes Abbas. Barghouti described the text as an "unjustified fallback which will adversely affect the Palestinian position".  &#10;&#10;Moreover, the draft was not put forward as a Chapter VII resolution, which would entail punitive measures for lack of compliance. As such, even if it was passed, Israel - which flatly condemned the PA's push from the outset - would be free to ignore it without consequence, as it has done with all the numerous Security Council resolutions over the decades.  &#10;&#10;Indeed, the draft did not contain any wording that would cause Israel to worry.  &#10;&#10;Given that the US veto shields Israel, and that existing resolutions are ignored with impunity, it is astounding that the PA had any faith left in the Council to attempt its latest futile exercise at statehood.  &#10;&#10;Even the response of its UN Ambassador Riyad Mansour was telling in this regard; "The Security Council has once again failed to uphold its charter duties to address this crises and to meaningfully contribute to a lasting solution in accordance with its own resolutions."  &#10;&#10;It has long been clear that the UN is a highly unlikely place for Palestinians to seek justice, as the consistent wishes and support of the international community for their cause is held hostage by just one country. The very notion of Security Council vetoes makes the UN an inherently and woefully undemocratic institution. The irony is that in the case of Palestine, a democracy is to blame.  &#10;&#10;The US ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, had the gall to say the resolution undermined efforts to "achieve two states for two people". The entire point of the resolution was to create a state that the existing state is determined to deny.  &#10;&#10;As such, one wonders if she even read the draft. It seems the mere mention of Israel automatically triggers an American veto.  &#10;&#10;This whole months-long affair was an obvious exercise in futility, during which time Israel has further entrenched its occupation and colonisation of Palestine. The day after the resolution failed, Abbas signed a document requesting membership of the International Criminal Court.  &#10;&#10;Given numerous previous threats to join the ICC, this is a welcome development. However, he should have done this the moment Palestine's upgraded status at the UN allowed it do so more than two years ago. Amid Israel's relentless colonisation and occupation, and after more than 20 years of fruitless negotiations, the Palestinians do not have the luxury of waiting indefinitely for statehood.  &#10;&#10;As such, the PA must act with the necessary urgency and focus.  	Palestinians should have known that the US would vote 'no'.&#10;&#10;
191-parisattacksfailurerepublic	aljazeera	Mon, 19 Jan 2015 11:37:54 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/01/paris-attacks-failure-republic-201511971012409339.html	Ali Saad	The Paris attacks and the failure of the republic	Following the Paris attacks, there appears to be a consensus that France has experienced a turning point in its modern history. Most commentators place an emphasis on the possible role external factors have played in this act of terrorism.  &#10;&#10;Various external factors are cited, but they mostly focus on the conflicts in the Middle East and international tensions in general, in a bid to link the Paris attacks to extremist ideologies that promote such murderous acts.  &#10;&#10;A week after the attack, the French political class and key media outlets remain focused on the security aspect and barely attempt to address the issue from a different angle. They do not question the responsibility held by French society and state - as well as the role of the socioeconomic policies practised by successive French governments - in addressing the woes of the socially marginalised and disenfranchised zones from which the Kouachi brothers sprang.  &#10;&#10;How can this act be attributed only to dogmatic ideological motivations and grievances over international conflicts, given that the religious and ideological indoctrination process is too complicated to be attributed solely to external factors?  &#10;&#10;As both French officials and analysts respond with emotion, they ignore a series of socioeconomic factors that have fuelled the motivations of the actors.  &#10;&#10;It is important to remember that the perpetrators of the attack were born and raised in France in a poor, disadvantaged area where unemployment rates among the youth aged 18 to 24 years reaches 45 percent (compared to the national rate which is nearly 10 percent).  &#10;&#10;In these areas, called "banlieues", state infrastructure is almost non- existent and the population is subject to segregation and racial discrimination in terms of access to employment opportunities and housing, which in most cases leads to exclusion from the civic sphere.  &#10;&#10;In 2006, an official case study focusing on access to employment conditions showed that 51 percent of young French candidates are subject to discrimination based on ethnic origin and/or skin colour.  &#10;&#10;These conditions result in social marginalisation and promote delinquency which in turn raises the chances of incarceration; a place where religious indoctrination and ideological radicalisation mostly occur.  &#10;&#10;Sociologist Robert Castel describes the situation of young people in these deprived areas as follows: "These young people are not completely [living] outside of society, however, they are not inside it either, for they do not enjoy any recognised space/role [...] Their situation is pretty paradoxical: they are citizens, who live on French territory, and yet they undergo differential and discriminatory treatment that disqualifies them. The republic, in contradiction with its own principles, seems incapable of integrating these young French people who live like the indigenous minority of the nation."  &#10;&#10;This, combined with a conflicting social context that is constantly fuelled by debates over identity, religion and behavioural issues (such as the debate on national identity, the veil, halal food in schools, Islam and French secularism) further stigmatise this community and place it in a permanent state of confrontation with the rest of society.  &#10;&#10;This vicious cycle prevents any change in the dynamics of this relationship into a cooperative one that could help find solutions in order to improve their socioeconomical status.  &#10;&#10;Not to mention the mainstream media discourse permanently framing those zones and communities as an ailment to the society. Young people are depicted in a caricaturist form, making it all the more difficult for them to socially and professionally integrate, which deepens their sense of marginalisation.  &#10;&#10;Such dynamics only complicate the relationship with the government, often seen as an opponent and sometimes as an enemy. This is the gap where religious indoctrination factors sneaks in - often occurring in prison environments where ethnic groups are predominantly from these areas and where 18- to 30 -year-olds represent 35 percent of the incarcerated population.  &#10;&#10;Are these good enough reasons to explain the motives behind committing such a terrorist act? Of course not. But the conditions described above constitute the factors that facilitate and accelerate the ideological and religious indoctrination process.  &#10;&#10;Especially when protagonists have the financial resources (this is often the case) to attract the most fragile, the most helpless and the most excluded in order to step forward and enrol in extremist activities, the international context helps.  &#10;&#10;With such a grim reality, the question going forward would be if purely security measures are sufficient to challenge the terrorism that threatens France. We expected to find an answer to this question in Prime Minister Manuel Valls's speech at the National Assembly in which he outlined "exceptional" measures to be taken.  &#10;&#10;"France is at war against terrorism and against radical Islam," he said. "Exceptional measures will be taken to challenge terrorism."  &#10;&#10;Valls mentioned exclusively security measures, such as reinforcing supervision within the prisons where Islamist prisoners are concentrated; establishing inter-European border controls; strengthening international intelligence cooperation ... however, there was no mention of a possible revision of the government’s social policies to address the problems in the marginalised zones; no announcement of a reflection on a possible serious debate to propose a new approach to address all the socioeconomic ills affecting them.  &#10;&#10;The security measures announced by the prime minister are necessary, but not sufficient to contain terrorism; the roots of extremism, where the first frustrations are formed, remain untouched.  &#10;&#10;That is not to say that the French government should be solely held responsible for the situation which France is facing today. Nevertheless, failing to take into account the catastrophic socioeconomic factor would be tantamount to promoting the very context that contributes to the development of fundamentalist ideologies.  &#10;&#10;The government urgently needs to review its social and economic policies towards these disadvantaged areas, developing real socioeconomic infrastructure, strengthening solidarity, emphasising the fight against discrimination in employment and housing, strengthening anti-racist laws and promoting a fairer media discourse towards these populations in order to improve their lot in life.  &#10;&#10;This will undoubtedly contribute towards sterilising any niches where extremist ideology can take root.  	The French government must review its policies towards poor, disadvantaged&#10;neighbourhoods.&#10;&#10;

No electorate has approved it. No parliament has passed it. No judge supervises its application and no jury determines guilt beyond reasonable doubt. There’s no right of appeal. And the penalty is death. It is enforced not by a police bound by codes of conduct, but by a fear that dare not speak its name; a cowardice so total it lacks the courage to admit it is afraid.  &#10;&#10;The British are the world’s worst cowards. It is one thing to say you don’t approve of Charlie Hebdo’s cartoons. But the BBC, Channel 4 and many newspapers won’t run any images of Mohammad whatsoever. They would at least have acknowledged censorship if they had announced that they were frightened of attacks on their staff. They would have clung to a remnant of their honour if they had said: “We are not censoring out of respect. We loathe the murderers who enforce their taboos with Kalashnikovs. But we do not want to spend years living in hiding, as Salman Rushdie did. Or be stabbed in the street, as Theo van Gogh was. Or hear an Islamist smash at our door with an axe and cry: “We will get our revenge,” – as Kurt Westergaard did. So we are backing away.”  &#10;&#10;Admittedly, an honest admission that terror works would shred the pretence that journalists are fearless speakers of truth to power. But it would be a small gesture of solidarity. It would say to everyone, from Pakistani secularists murdered for opposing theocratic savagery, to British parents worried sick that their boys will join Islamic State, that radical Islam is a real fascistic force.  &#10;&#10;Instead, most journalists have lived a lie for years, as have many in the arts, academia and comedy. We take on the powerful – and ask you to admire our bravery – if, and only if, the powerful are not a paramilitary force that may kill us.  &#10;&#10;The mass murder of cartoonists and police officers at Charlie Hebdo, and the attacks on Jews, which revive so many foul memories of European fascism, will change our world – almost certainly for the worst. Unless we find the courage to overcome fear, the self-censorship will spread, and not only in the media.  &#10;&#10;Colleagues who wanted historians at a London museum to talk about the long history of depictions of Muhammad in Islamic art last week were met with panicking press officers trying to shut them up. Historian Tom Holland, who received death threats after he challenged the creation myths of Islam, said: “I cannot think of any other area of history where debate is so nervous.” He hopes that historians will continue to say that the Koran was a manmade creation, but doubts that journalists will be keen to take their work to the public.  &#10;&#10;This is not a small capitulation. In the 19th century, the textual criticism of German scholars revealed that the supposed word of God in the Bible was a mess of competing stories. It did as much damage to Christianity and Judaism as Darwinism. Anyone hoping to repeat the exercise by taking apart the Koran and the hadiths today will be restrained by the fear that they will end up as dead as satirists who try to do the same with anti-clerical humour.  &#10;&#10;My friend and comrade Maajid Nawaz was a jihadi before he converted to liberalism and understands the totalitarian mind. He says that people still do not realise that radical Islamists do not just want to impose their taboos at gunpoint. They want to “create a civil war” so that European Muslims accept that they can only live in the caliphate; to encourage the rise of the white far-right so that ordinary coexistence becomes impossible. If they win one demand, as they are winning in Britain, then they will up the tension and move to another.  &#10;&#10;As soon as you look at demands rather than labels, the wall dividing extremists from the rest begins to crumble. Saudi Arabia is Britain’s trusted partner and ally. It receives vast quantities of armaments and in turn pumps propaganda into British mosques and universities. As Paris looked like a war zone, it flogged the Saudi liberal Raif Badawi for insulting Islam. At least they did not kill him, you might say. But if the religious courts had found him guilty of apostasy – that is, of taking the adult decision to abandon the religion of his childhood – the sentence would have been death.  &#10;&#10;European liberals ought to have stopped, as the lash fell on Badawi’s shoulders, and wondered about their queasiness at criticising the religions of the “powerless”and “marginalised”. The Saudi Arabian monarchy is all too powerful, as are the other dictatorships of the Middle East. Power depends on where you stand and who stands below you. The unemployed man with the gun is more powerful than the Parisian journalist. The marginal cleric may have a hard life, but if he sits in a sharia court imposing misogynist rules on British Muslim women he is to be feared.  &#10;&#10;European liberals might try to be true to their principles and ally with dissidents, liberals, leftists and free thinkers within Muslim communities. They might help ex-Muslims who fear that one day they will be murdered for apostasy. They might reflect that a Muslim man will encounter xenophobia from the right, but they will hear no rigorous criticism at university or other leftist institutions of the sexism, anti-semitism, homophobia and bloodlust of militant religion.  &#10;&#10;Self-interest ought to be a motivator. Fear of radical Islam is not only driving support for the National Front in France and Ukip here, but providing an excuse for more attacks on civil liberties, including, despite David Cameron’s pious words after Charlie Hebdo, attacks on freedom of speech.  &#10;&#10;I hope I am wrong, but I cannot see a culture shift on this necessary scale happening. I fear we must look forward to a lying and frightened future.  	Nick Cohen: We take on the powerful – and ask you to admire our bravery – only if they are not a paramilitary force that may kill us

Like so many young people in the Middle East, I found an outlet on social media. I was quickly labelled "an artist of the revolution".  &#10;&#10;Today, my work is shared around the world. In my native Sudan, as well as in Yemen and Tunisia, my cartoons are used by revolutionary groups and by political activists.  &#10;&#10;This is my passion. I don't make a living off these political cartoons. In fact, I encourage people to copy and share them. It is an honour, but it does not come without dangers.  &#10;&#10;It's no easy feat to come up with a cartoon that can pass all levels of censorship - starting with self-censorship then government-imposed "coronership", which in many countries in this region, is actually somebody's job - to pick apart and find potentially offensive meanings.  &#10;&#10;That's why I understand why the West is fighting so hard to keep that freedom of speech as free as it should be. In the wake of the deplorable attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, I wholeheartedly join the rest of the world in condemning the actions of those three young men.  &#10;&#10;I condemn the attacks on the cartoonists even though I don't agree with the publication's editorial slant, which I have often found to be hurtful and racist. Nevertheless, I would continue to stand for their freedom of speech.  &#10;&#10;I believe that the assailants' religion or ideology is irrelevant; I believe they were simply looking to wage an attack; they would have attacked something else if they didn't attack Charlie Hebdo.  &#10;&#10;Muslims seem to lose either way. They are constantly asked to apologise for crimes they neither committed, nor supported. They, too, are victims of the violence of extremists. Still, they are asked to apologise and somehow atone for these crimes that were committed in the name of their religion. Then they must face the wrath of extremists who attack them for refusing to approve of the methods they view as the only way to defend Islam.  &#10;&#10;This situation is a perpetuation of what's happening in the Middle East right now - it's far more complex than the cartoon business. For us to help, to play a constructive role, we should desist from pointing the finger at others, and we must examine what motivates these young people to turn to violence and extremism.  &#10;&#10;Freedom of speech is a powerful weapon and one I have never fully had - but for those who do have it, I wish they would stop taking it for granted.  &#10;&#10;Instead, they ought to ask the right questions - the questions that need to be asked - rather than accusatory ones that fuel the stereotypes that have originated in mainstream media.  &#10;&#10;Their work must focus on conveying the right message. They must work towards bridging the gap - and not widening it.  	An Arab Muslim cartoonist condemns the Paris attacks even though he finds the&#10;magazine's editorial slant hurtful.&#10;&#10;

We have to condemn what happened in Paris absolutely. I said the same after 7/7 and after 9/11. And after Jordan and Bali and Mali.  &#10;&#10;It is particularly important to be clear about where we stand, for the attackers said things that cannot be allowed to go unchallenged. They said they were avenging the prophet. That was wrong. In fact, it is the message of Islam, our principles and values, that have been betrayed and tainted. They refer to Islam to justify what they did. From a religious viewpoint, I feel it is my responsibility to say that this has nothing to do with the message of our religion. I would expect anyone, if something was happening in the name of their country or in the name of their religion, to take a stand. As a Muslim scholar I have to take that stand.  &#10;&#10;That said, there is also a wider political side to this equation. We condemn what happened in France. We condemn the violent extremism that is targeting westerners. But it is not only westerners. We are reacting emotionally because 12 people were killed in Paris, but there are hundreds being killed day in, day out in Syria and Iraq, and still we send more bombs. We have to look at the big picture. Lives matter, but it is important to be clear that the lives of Muslims in Muslim majority countries have as much value as our own lives in the west.  &#10;&#10;What happened this week is a tragedy heightened by familiarity, for I met the cartoonist Charb (Stéphane Charbonnier), the editor of Charlie Hebdo, who was among those killed on Wednesday. We had a debate in which I told him that I respected his freedom to say whatever he wanted to say, and that there was no justification for any kind of censorship.  &#10;&#10;But I also told him that he had to be clear about the way he was using that right. In 2008 his magazine fired a cartoonist who made a joke about a Jewish link to President Sarkozy’s son. Where was the freedom of expression there, I asked the satirical magazine. I was told that when it comes to freedom of expression that there are limits, not everything can be said. The double standard is troubling, to say the least.  &#10;&#10;I am shocked that something as terrible as this has happened to Charb and his colleagues, but less surprised that there was a backlash against them. There had been controversy concerning Charlie Hebdo on an almost six-monthly basis, and lots of threats. To have a sense of humour is fine, I told them, but to target an already stigmatised people in France is not really showing much courage.  &#10;&#10;The shootings have been described as an act of war. I can understand why some might characterise it that way. But they are wrong to do so, for isn’t this exactly what the violent extremists such as Da’esh, so-called Islamic State, want? They want to say the west is at war with Islam, but if we are to take the action of marginal groups and use that as evidence that there is a war between Islam and the west, aren’t we merely falling into a trap?  &#10;&#10;George Bush fell into that very trap immediately after 9/11 by calling it the war on terror, but actually he promoted it with his rhetoric. The most we can reasonably say now is that we are at war with violent extremists, wherever they are coming from. But why play that game at all? Let’s be specific: these are criminals exploiting Islam. The great majority of the victims are actually Muslim.  &#10;&#10;There are tensions in many countries, but things have been very difficult of late in France. Two recently published books reflect the atmosphere: very negative and very demoralising. The French Suicide by Eric Zemmour expresses the fear that millions of Muslims might be colonising and transforming the country (he is hoping they will be helped to leave), and Michel Houellebecq’s novel Submission, which predicts that in 2022 an Islamic party will take over France. Three years ago, Houellebecq said Islam was the most stupid religion in the world.  &#10;&#10;In the UK, in terms of daily life, the situation is better. There isn’t that feeling of permanent stigmatisation in the discourse as happens in France. But even so, things feel as if they are changing for the worse. It is no accident that Ukip has been on the rise, and in such a climate one feels the public discourse changing. There are parties happy to target migrants and to target Muslims. It’s a drift we have to stop, for in my view we actually have a shared responsibility. Politicians, intellectuals, journalists, Muslims and people of other faiths (or none) must be clear and united about our common principles. We need politicians with more on their minds than winning the next election.  &#10;&#10;One sees difficult days ahead as yesterday’s dramatic events in France showed; and there is the issue of media organisations intent on publishing the most offensive Charlie Hebdo cartoons, claiming that it would strike a blow for free speech. I support free speech, but I would urge them to desist, for what they plan to do is not courageous and will do nothing to afford people dignity. It will be another example of targeting all Muslims. It would say that if our fellow Muslim citizens are not part of the equation, we will target not the extremists – but Islam itself. It would hand the extremists a victory they could scarcely have achieved for themselves.

(AP/File)  &#10;&#10;Last week, France faced the threat that is arguably the toughest to defeat—a threat from within, from its own terrorists.  &#10;&#10;By now, the stories are familiar. France has a problem with homegrown radicals. At least 900 French citizens are among the 2,000 to 3,000 westerners who’ve left home for jihadist training or to fight for ISIS in Syria and Iraq.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;In many ways, the western jihadist represents the worst threat. Able to speak the language fluently, completely familiar with their home countries, and possessing a key weapon -- an American, British, French, or German passport -- they can easily cross international boundaries.  &#10;&#10;The training makes them deadly -- the Paris attacks were notable for their deadly precision and meticulous planning. Their citizenship makes them mobile.  &#10;&#10;That’s why any American strategy to defeat jihad has to include measures to not just deny passports to American terrorists, but also strip them of citizenship. This is basic common sense.  &#10;&#10;Most Americans would be surprised to know that joining Al Qaeda or ISIS – the Islamic State – isn’t grounds for losing citizenship. The law currently provides that Americans can lose citizenship when they enter or serve in the armed forces of an enemy foreign state. But ISIS and Al Qaeda are not “foreign states,” so the law doesn’t apply.  &#10;&#10;It’s time to close this loophole.  &#10;&#10;In Congress, legislation was introduced last session to address those concerns. It was not approved. Now, in the new Congress – with Republicans in control of both the House and Senate – there’s a renewed push to safeguard the homeland.  &#10;&#10;Last week, Representative Ted Poe introduced a measure that revokes passports from Americans who join terrorist organizations. And, in the days ahead, Senator Ted Cruz and Representative Steve King are expected to introduce legislation that would strip citizenship from terrorist traitors.  &#10;&#10;This is not an imaginary threat. Not only have Americans joined ISIS, some have even lost their lives fighting for jihadists. In fact, as many as 40 men from Minneapolis alone have joined Islamic groups abroad. And just last week in Chicago, A U.S. citizen was indicted by a federal grand jury – charged with attempting to travel overseas to fight alongside the ISIS operating in Iraq and Syria.  &#10;&#10;These men aren’t just threats to the United States; they’re also threats to our closest allies. For our allies, the American passport is a ticket of entry, no visa required. And, similarly, for British, French, and other allies, their passport is a ticket of entry into the United States. The door is wide open for terrorists to take advantage of centuries of friendship and trust. It is time we slam that door shut.  &#10;&#10;Of course stripping citizenship and revoking passports represent just two small steps – but critical ones – towards a sane national security strategy. However, it’s difficult to take even these small steps with the Obama administration steadfastly refuses to name our enemies (Mr. President, our enemies are Islamic radicals, not generic “extremists”), accurately describe their ideology (no, they are not “nihilists”), or even to acknowledge their obvious, widespread appeal in the Muslim world.  &#10;&#10;It was sad and embarrassing for Americans to watch as even the leader of the Palestinian Authority marched in Paris against Islamic extremism, yet our president or vice president were nowhere to be found. Even liberal journalists called this absence “pathetic.”  &#10;&#10;Marches don’t defeat terrorists, but when dozens of world leaders stand together, it makes a statement of determination that is critical for our citizens to see. When our President makes a stand, it signals our nation’s resolve, and his absence signaled our government’s weakness.  &#10;&#10;In the days and weeks ahead, Congress can send a very different message by passing much needed legislation, putting it on the President’s desk, and daring him to veto legislation that would prevent exactly the kind of attack France faced last week.  &#10;&#10;After almost six full years in office, we fully understand the President’s approach to combatting terrorism. A recipe that mixes drone strikes with appeasement—that pulls troops from combat and sends captive terrorists back to the Middle—is now a proven failure.  &#10;&#10;In my bestselling book, "Rise of ISIS: A Threat We Can’t Ignore," I demonstrated the consequences of that failure. Jihad rages across the Middle East, Boko Harem rampages through Nigeria, and Afghanistan teeters on the brink of disaster. In the west, recent terror attacks in Canada, Australia, and Paris show jihadists ability to inspire even western Muslims with a message of pure hate and evil.  &#10;&#10;Will the Obama administration change course? Will it finally acknowledge the true dimensions of the threat? It can start with a dose of common sense. It can start by protecting America from terrorist traitors.  	That’s why any American strategy to defeat jihad has to include measures to&#10;not just deny passports to American terrorists, but also strip them of&#10;citizenship.&#10;&#10;

File- Jan. 9, 2015: President Obama speaking about the France newspaper attack. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)  &#10;&#10;President Obama was a no-show Sunday at the unity rally in Paris. There were leaders from around the world. Eric Holder, the lame duck Attorney General was sent in Obama\'s absence. Holder was in Paris for an anti-terrorism summit. He did not appear with other world leaders at the rally.  &#10;&#10;I wonder what was on Obama\'s schedule that was more important to the president than showing radical Islam we mean business?  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;I trust the president\'s absence had nothing to do with his well-documented refusal to tie terror to where it comes from. The radical wing within the Muslim community. By not showing up and locking arms with President François Hollande, Chancellor Angela Merkel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, PLO Chairman Mahmoud Abbas, and others...has our president hat tipped terrorists that we in America still are afraid to offend them?  &#10;&#10;It was a nice show of solidarity in Paris on Sunday. But will world leaders respond with action or return to their respective countries and not just declare war on radical Islam? They must actively seek to root out radicals and destroy their infrastructure. Enough have died at the hands of these savages. They have no right to hide behind "no-go zones."  &#10;&#10;I first mentioned the extensive network of "no-go" zones in Britain and France after the beheading of a British soldier in the streets of London by a radical Muslim.  &#10;&#10;The left called me intolerant.  &#10;&#10;I was called Islamophobic by CAIR.  &#10;&#10;I didn\'t care then, and I could care even less, now.  &#10;&#10;Back home, we need to make sure there are no safe places for terror in America.  &#10;&#10;There are pockets of high density Muslim populations all the across the United States.  &#10;&#10;We are free in America to live where and how we choose. And, of course, that applies to Muslim communities, too, as long as these places are not hiding terror cells.  &#10;&#10;Law enforcement has a responsibility to make sure that there are no areas where they are afraid to police. They have a responsibility to ensure these areas are not breeding places of terror.  &#10;&#10;Our elected officials need to back law enforcement with strong support. And they need to arm law enforcement with the tools they need to keep our country safe. -- That means intelligence support, arming them adequately and letting them know that We the People support law enforcement.  &#10;&#10;But here’s the bottom line: If you intend to hurt Americans, you will be tracked, followed and profiled.  &#10;&#10;Sorry, does that sound politically incorrect? Too bad!  &#10;&#10;How many more beheaded journalists or massacres of innocents do we need to rethink the current administration\'s political correctness strategy?  &#10;&#10;It simply didn\'t work. It made liberal progressives feel better about their tolerance but that tolerance has turned deadly over and over again.  &#10;&#10;Finally, watching those leaders marching through the Paris streets sans Obama, I wanted to shout, "Hey Islamic terrorists, he doesn\'t speak for me!" And likely MILLIONS of Americans, who are ready to fight for our freedom and safety feel the same way.  &#10;&#10;Matt Drudge may have summed up the Obama presidency perfectly in less than 140 characters:  &#10;&#10;@DRUDGE: ALL Obama moves are designed to further his career in global govt after he leaves White House. Understand this, and things make more sense.  	I wonder what was on President Obama's schedule that was more important to&#10;than showing radical Islam we mean business?&#10;&#10;
197-paristerrorattackjournalismisu	foxnews	2015-01-07T15:21:18Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/01/07/paris-terror-attack-journalism-is-under-fire/	Howard Kurtz	Paris terror attack: Journalism is under fire 	  &#10;&#10;Courageous journalism is under attack today.  &#10;&#10;The horrifying shooting by masked gunmen at a Paris magazine office, which has left 12 dead, is an assault on everyone in the news business.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;And the fact that the paper, Charlie Hebdo, is a satirical publication matters not at all, since satire can sting as sharply as any media commentary — especially when it comes to the sensitive subject of religion.  &#10;&#10;Several news outlets are reporting that the attackers identified themselves as being from Al Qaeda in Yemen. But whatever branch of Islamic terrorism is responsible for this heinous crime, the targeting of the French paper is no accident.  &#10;&#10;On its cover today is a caricature of a controversial novelist, Michel Houellebecq, whose book “Submission” forecasts a France run by Muslims and where polygamy is practiced. And the last tweet posted by the magazine was a mocking spoof of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.  &#10;&#10;Charlie Hebdo has been a target before. Its offices were firebombed in 2011 after the paper ran a cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad vowing “100 lashes if you don’t die laughing!”  &#10;&#10;The vicious attack would be shocking news even if the target was an insurance company office. But by singling out a media enterprise — especially one that has dared to poke fun at Islam — the terrorists are sending an even louder message, one designed to frighten and intimidate.  &#10;&#10;We saw the same evil calculation in the decision by ISIS to kill journalists James Foley and Steve Sotloff and to circulate video of their beheadings. This was a way to amplify the propaganda value of such executions and generate even more coverage by journalists who felt an instinctive kinship with their fallen brethren.  &#10;&#10;That ploy worked, as ISIS sparked weeks of anguished coverage around the globe, and the images of the soon-to-be-murdered journalists, published far too often in my view, became the face of Islamic terror. After that, even as the U.S. and its allies struck back at ISIS in Iraq and Syria, the coverage greatly receded. Terrorists understand the media’s need to personalize a tragic story.  &#10;&#10;Wednesday’s attack was also a far bloodier version of the Sony Pictures hacking, which was aimed at paralyzing and humiliating a media company over its ill-advised film that depicted North Korean strongman Kim Jong-un’s head being blown up. That act of cyberterrorism also served as a warning to other media outfits that might take on North Korea.  &#10;&#10;Charlie Hebdo specialized in skewering sacred cows. “Its pages are filled with vulgar caricatures and caustic humor, lampooning politicians, entertainers and media personalities of all stripes,” the New York Times reported three years ago, “and the magazine has found itself a frequent presence at Paris courts, accused on several dozen occasions of defamation or inciting hate.  &#10;&#10;“The world’s religions have also been favorite targets of the paper, this being France, where state-mandated secularism is a sort of religion of its own. The cover page of one recent issue featured a cartoon of three rolls of toilet paper, labeled Bible, Koran and Torah, and the headline: ‘In the toilet, all the religions.’”  &#10;&#10;The danger now is that journalists around the world will engage in self- censorship, that they will pull back on aggressive reporting and analysis of Islamic terrorism. For every potentially provocative article, headline or cartoon, some will ask themselves, is this worth the risk? Wouldn’t it be easier, safer, to let this one go?  &#10;&#10;And each time that happens, the gunmen who unleashed a hail of bullets in a Paris magazine office Wednesday will have won.  &#10;&#10;Howard Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of "MediaBuzz" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

Sadly, they’ve all missed the point.  &#10;&#10;It would have represented a glaring hypocrisy for Mr. Obama, or any highly- ranked official from his administration, to attend the rally.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;A sad fact about our pundit class, conservative or progressive, is that they too often miss the obvious. That condition infects both critics and supporters of the Obama administration. They simply cannot connect the dots with this leader. After all, he is an unusual president.  &#10;&#10;So let me draw a line between the unconnected dots.  &#10;&#10;Just two years ago, the administration blamed the killing of the American ambassador to Libya, and three security personnel, on a video that negatively depicted the prophet Muhammad. Remember that?  &#10;&#10;You see, it was an unknown, bigoted Christian man from California who single- handedly caused the death of our ambassador. According to the administration, the film by Nakoula Basseley Nakoulahad sparked spontaneous riots to defend Muhammad’s honor, and our ambassador got caught up in the mayhem.  &#10;&#10;Mr. Obama called the filmmaker a “shadowy character,” and in front of the United Nations and the world, blamed the attack on the “disgusting” movie. At that podium, he declared that “the future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam.”  &#10;&#10;Congressional hearings later proved that the violence in Benghazi was due to a coordinated terrorist attack, and had nothing to do with a protest over the movie. But administration officials stuck to the lie.  &#10;&#10;Just a few weeks after the attack, the filmmaker was arrested on parole charges by federal authorities, probably taking orders from Attorney General Holder.  &#10;&#10;Now fast-forward to the rally in Paris—the one that Holder would not deem worthy to attend, even though he was in Paris at the time. The one that President Obama, nor Vice President Biden, nor Secretary of State Kerry would attend either, even though other major world leaders rushed to Paris to demonstrate their solidarity.  &#10;&#10;Let me draw the line between the dots a little darker:  &#10;&#10;Q: Who did the terrorists attack in Paris on January 7?  &#10;&#10;A: A satirist magazine that had mocked Christians for years.  &#10;&#10;Q: Why did the terrorists kill those specific journalists and cartoonists?  &#10;&#10;A: For a mocking portrayal of Muhammad.  &#10;&#10;Q: Isn’t that the same issue that had enraged the White House after the Benghazi attack?  &#10;&#10;A: You betcha.  &#10;&#10;The “bad optics” that so many pundits are complaining about actually fit perfectly into the philosophical mindset of this White House. They do not want us to insult their Islamist friends.  &#10;&#10;In the eyes of the Obama administration, the jihadists in Libya and France committed the same savagery for the same reason.  &#10;&#10;Give the administration credit for consistency. They’re not about to appear sympathetic to a French cartoonist when they had condemned the filmmaker from California. Having persecuted the latter, they weren’t about to march to defend the former.  &#10;&#10;What represents bad optics to most civilized people’s worldview represents good optics to the Obama administration’s worldview.  &#10;&#10;It’s all too clear that America and the world have no hope of stopping these never-ending barbaric acts until a Reagan-like figure steps up. A leader who will honestly and courageously define such terrorism as it really is: An Islamist’s interpretation of the Koran.  &#10;&#10;That’s the definition recently used by President el-Sisi of Egypt, a man of far greater honesty and courage than America’s current counterpart.  &#10;&#10;Only with an American leader of Reagan-like strength will we be able to develop a plan and the determination to defeat the dark ideology of Islamism, just like Reagan managed to defeat the Soviet Union and its evil ideology.  &#10;&#10;Dr. Michael Youssef is the founding pastor of the Church of the Apostles in Atlanta, Georgia and the author of over 30 books, including his most recent, "Jesus, Jihad & Peace: What Does Bible Prophecy Say About World Events Today?"

The truth is I’ve let go of the family I grew up in, and found true happiness. That can be a tempting but tough sell at the holidays, when television and media bombard us with images of generations of blissful families gathering around a table or tree. The idea of really putting my past behind me seems to fly in the face of the spirit of the holidays. But in reality that’s exactly what the season calls for.  &#10;&#10;I was raised in Hollywood, plopped into a sudsy bathtub for my first Johnson & Johnson Baby Shampoo commercial before I’d reached my first birthday. When I was eight I landed a role on one of the biggest television hits of the time, "Little House on the Prairie," playing Michael Landon’s daughter opposite my fictional older brother, Jason Bateman.  &#10;&#10;Throughout my childhood, I led a magical existence on dozens of sets, logging more than a hundred commercials, and countless shows and movies, but behind the scenes, the story was less idyllic. My success was fueled by a dangerously competitive stage mother whose drive knew no limits. While I flourished under in the spotlight of her attention and ambition, my older sister, Tiffany, shrunk into the shadows. She could never please our mother, and her sense of worthlessness and defeat eventually destroyed her.  &#10;&#10;Our family came to an explosive end. But until I finally put my story down on paper in "Diary of a Stage Mother’s Daughter," writing the history down for myself, I had no idea how to explain what happened to other people. I didn’t know where to start, especially with my two young sons. To be honest, the story is embarrassing, filled with details that make me question if my mother ever loved us. I found the conversation easier when I stuck to vague answers.  &#10;&#10;But when my older son turned four, he asked me if my husband’s mom was my mom, too. Once again, I pulled out a non-lie that didn’t answer his real question. “No,” I said. But I’m sure my tone told him not to pursue the answer. That day I knew I needed to come to terms with the truth. I needed to own my story because we both deserved to be okay with the truth.  &#10;&#10;When "Diary" hit stores though, I was in for a real shock. All the time I spent hide and covering my truth was for nothing. Person after person said, “I read your story and I feel so close to you now. The same thing happened to me!” When they tell me their story though, the substance and details are entirely different, but what’s the same is that they’ve endured a trauma, a trial, a life-stopping event.  &#10;&#10;Turns out, we could all write a book. Almost all of us have heartbreak in our pasts. But rather than carrying that pain and letting it paralyze us, I suggest that history is a richness of experience to draw upon. I know what damages a family and the hope and healing that can come from a fresh start. And for me, that meant ending my relationship with an abusive mother. I vowed the madness, grief, and pain of our family would end with me, and it did. I wanted a different future, and chose to take a brighter path.  &#10;&#10;Even at the holidays, when a department store or jewelry maker runs a commercials showing an impossibly large family traveling over snowy roads to be together and exchange gifts, I know in my heart I made the right decision.  &#10;&#10;So if you feel weighed down by your past, turn the page and write a new future. You can choose to be happy. You can choose a joyful future. It’s never too late.  	I’ve let go of the family I grew up in, and found true happiness. That can be&#10;a tempting but tough sell at the holidays.&#10;&#10;
200-peaceonearthatheism	guardian	2015-01-06T12:30:00Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/06/peace-on-earth-atheism	Adam Lee	If peace on earth is our goal, atheism might be the means to that end	The quiet truth behind the inescapable headlines about man’s inhumanity to man is that the world is actually becoming a more peaceful place. Deaths from war and conflict have been declining for decades – and, if current trends continue, we can make them rarer still.  &#10;&#10;What mysterious force is sowing peace among humankind? One possible reason is that there are more atheists and nonbelievers than ever before.  &#10;&#10;In America, millennials are the largest and least religious generation in the country’s history. The trend toward secularization in the US mirrors the movement in Europe and throughout the developed world. And poll after poll have shown that the nonreligious also lean more progressive and more pacifist on a wide variety of issues relating to violence: torture, the death penalty, corporal punishment, military adventurism and more.  &#10;&#10;A Pew poll from 2009, well before the Senate released its devastating torture report last month, asked whether torturing suspected terrorists could be justified found that the non-religious were most opposed to torture, with a combined 55% saying that it could rarely or never be justified. Gallup has also found that people with no religious preference are less supportive of the death penalty than any group of Christians. The non-religious are also among the most likely to say the invasion of Iraq was a mistake. The religiously unaffiliated are also less likely than Christians to believe that the US is superior to all other countries in the world, a hyper-patriotic attitude that’s hardly conducive to careful reflection about the use of American military power.  &#10;&#10;Religion’s violent tendencies also tend to be reflected in its adherents’ personal lives. The social scientists Christopher Ellison and Darren Sherkat found that conservative Protestants disproportionately support the use of corporal punishment, such as spanking or whipping, for children. The researchers speculate that this stems from theology: Christians who promote a literal interpretation of the Bible tend to believe that human nature is inherently evil, and that sin demands severe punishment. What’s more, the Bible itself (among its many other bloody verses) specifically calls for beating children in verses such as Proverbs 13:24. (By contrast, freethinkers like the famous American orator Robert Ingersoll recognized the cruelty of corporal punishment as early as 1877.)  &#10;&#10;As long as humanity was in thrall to the violent morality of religious texts, our societies were warlike and cruel. As the American revolutionary Thomas Paine said, belief in a cruel god makes a cruel man. It’s only in the last few decades, as we’ve begun to cast these beliefs off, that we’re making real moral progress.  &#10;&#10;The influence of the non-religious shows is also evident on an international scale. The nonprofit group Vision of Humanity publishes an annual Global Peace Index, which ranks countries on a broad spectrum of indicators, including violent crime, incarceration rates, weapon ownership, and military spending. Sociologist Phil Zuckerman summarizes their results in his new book Living the Secular Life:  &#10;&#10;...according to their most recent rankings, among the top ten most peaceful nations on earth, all are among the least God-believing – in fact, eight of the ten are specifically among the least theistic nations on earth. Conversely, of the bottom ten – the least peaceful nations – most of them are extremely religious.  &#10;&#10;Of course, not every atheist is peaceful and not every religious person is violent. Avowedly pacifist faiths like the Quakers or Unitarian Universalists have played an important role in peace movements and, in the other direction, there are lamentably prominent atheists like Sam Harris or the late Christopher Hitchens who’ve been entirely too cavalier about imperialism and military aggression. But in general, the trend is that, as the world becomes less religious, we can expect it to become even more peaceful.  	Adam Lee: The nonreligious are more liberal and more pacifist on most issues relating to violence: torture, the death penalty, corporal punishment, imperialism and more
201-philippineschinastandoffdav	aljazeera	Sun, 14 Dec 2014 03:21:53 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/philippines-china-standoff-dav-2014121363437729811.html	Richard Javad Heydarian	Philippines-China standoff: David vs Goliath? 	In recent years, the South China Sea has (once again) transformed into a theatre of competition among rival claimant states. Outmatched and outgunned by China, the Philippines has sought to resolve the disputes by resorting to legal arbitration, hoping that international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), will serve as an amicable basis for settling maritime conflicts.  &#10;&#10;But China has unequivocally rejected the arbitration process as an infringement on its national sovereignty and territorial integrity, recently releasing a position paper that details its rationale for opposing any third- party intervention in the disputes.  &#10;&#10;The South China Sea represents a potential flashpoint with global ramifications. Connecting one of the most dynamic economies of the 21st century, the waters facilitate more than $5 trillion in annual trade. Crucially, the bulk of the energy imports of industrial powerhouses such as Japan and South Korea pass through the South China Sea. The very economic survival and energy security of major Asian economies is anchored by unimpeded access to international waters such as the South China Sea.  &#10;&#10;Almost everyone has an interest in the peaceful settlement of the disputes. But it is far from certain whether the Philippines' legal manoeuvre will contribute to the de-escalation of maritime tensions. China has vehemently rejected the entire arbitration process, accusing the Philippines of stirring trouble and jeopardising historically stable bilateral ties.  &#10;&#10;Technically, the maritime disputes involve six rival claimant states: China, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Taiwan. The bitterest disputes, however, involve China, on one hand, and the Philippines and Vietnam, on the other. Fortunately, the latest wave of maritime spats hasn't yet sparked a full-scale military confrontation. The last bloody standoff was in the latter decades of the Cold War, when China tried to wrest control of the Paracel (1974) and the Spratly (1988) islands from the South Vietnamese and (united) Vietnam forces, respectively.  &#10;&#10;But amid a flurry of nationalist bombast, backed up by wide-ranging - civilian and military - construction activities as well as paramilitary patrols across disputed areas, there are growing concerns over accidental clashes and unintended escalation in the high seas.  &#10;&#10;In short, freedom of navigation (FoN) - a pillar of commerce and trade - in the South China Sea could be in peril.  &#10;&#10;Given the significance of the South China Sea to regional trade and security, non-claimant states such as the US, Japan, and Indonesia have also been drawn into the territorial disputes.  &#10;&#10;Washington is bound by treaty obligations to defend Asian allies such as the Philippines, against external aggression. As some commentators would put it, the maritime rivalries resemble a three-dimensional chess game, threatening strategic, economic, and political interests in the region, with ever-growing number of players injecting additional layers of complexity and risk to the problem.  &#10;&#10;While all actors have contributed to the escalation of tensions in the area, the consensus among independent experts is that China's sweeping claims, particularly its notorious "nine-dashed line" doctrine, has served as a major stumbling block in resolving the territorial disputes.  &#10;&#10;China's claims are simultaneously expansive and ambiguous. The "nine-dashed line" covers almost the entirety of the South China Sea, even overlapping with Indonesia's waters, but Beijing has not clarified its precise coordinates. It isn't clear whether China is claiming the land features and their surrounding territorial waters, or treating the entire area as an internal lake. China has evoked "historical rights" and "inherent and indisputable sovereignty" over the South China Sea, which, most experts believe, has little basis in modern international law.  &#10;&#10;Despite signing the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, which discourages claimant states from unilaterally altering the status quo, China has stepped up its construction activities and paramilitary patrols across disputed waters.  &#10;&#10;In terms of size and capabilities, China dwarfs all its neighbours combined. The regional geopolitical landscape is highly lopsided. Eager to maintain stable ties with Beijing, Washington has consistently refused to take sides in the disputes, limiting its concern to FoN in the South China Sea.  &#10;&#10;Against the backdrop of deteriorating regional security, leading to a brief and perilous standoff between Filipino and Chinese forces over the Scarborough Shoal (220 km off the coast of the Philippines, and 900km away from the nearest Chinese coastline).  &#10;&#10;In mid-2012, Manila decided to take China to the special Arbitral Tribunal in The Hague. As a signatory to the UNCLOS, China has (under Article 298) rejected compulsory arbitration over maritime disputes, but the tribunal has the power to determine whether it can exercise jurisdiction over the case and judge the merits of the Philippines' complaint against China.  &#10;&#10;The Philippines aim is to pressure China to clarify its claims as well as determine the nature of contested features in the South China Sea, specifically whether they can generate their own independent territorial waters. In the end, the Philippines might end up with a pyrrhic victory.  &#10;&#10;In the absence of any tangible compliance-enforcement mechanism, China can reject any unfavourable judicial outcome; launch a media campaign to delegitimise the arbitration proceedings; contemplate sanctions and other forms of diplomatic counter-manoeuvres to isolate the Philippines; and project toughness (to its domestic hyper-nationalist audience) by stepping up its activities in the area.  &#10;&#10;Ultimately, the best solution may lie in direct engagement, confidence- building measures, and sustained bilateral negotiations rather than compulsory arbitration. Both Manila and Beijing will have to devise a diplomatic strategy outside the courts of law.  	There are growing concerns over accidental clashes and unintended escalation&#10;in South China Sea waters.&#10;&#10;

Attendance is down, membership is down, even the number of people who identify as religious is down.  &#10;&#10;But in the midst of this downward trend, one expression of religious intensity is up. And not just up, but way up. What’s this mystery activity that more and more people are participating in?  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Pilgrimage.  &#10;&#10;In September, the United Nations held the first ever International Congress on Tourism and Pilgrimages. At the event, held in Santiago de Compostela in Spain, the organizers released a study that said a third of all tourists worldwide annually are pilgrims.  &#10;&#10;The U.N. puts the total number of people going on a pilgrimage each year at 330 million. That means nearly a million people every day are leaving their homes and going on a spiritual exploration.  &#10;&#10;Last year, I went on six of the biggest and most important of these pilgrimages in the course of 12 months. I bathed with 100 million people in the River Ganges, walked along the Jesus Trail in the Galilee, and trekked on an 750-miles Buddhist trail in Japan.  &#10;&#10;My travels, over 120,000 miles, were part of a new television series, “Sacred Journeys with Bruce Feiler,” that tells the story of the growing power of pilgrimage in the contemporary life.  &#10;&#10;Each hour of the six-hour series focuses on American pilgrims making one of these historic journeys. Some of these seekers don’t fit the stereotype of spiritual travelers.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;Dec. 12, 2014: A tear runs from the eye of a pilgrim as she looks up at the apron of Juan Diego, a 16th century relic believed to hold the imprint of the Virgin of Guadalupe, in Mexico City. Every year hundreds of thousands of people from across the country, many carrying images or statues of Mexico\'s patron saint to be blessed, converge at the Basilica on Dec. 12, the Virgin\'s feast day. Pilgrims are able to view the apron from moving walkways that pass below. (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell)  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;Last May I traveled with 40 wounded warriors from Iraq and Afghanistan to bathe in the sacred waters of Lourdes, France. Some of these genuine heroes had legs blown off, were blinded, or suffered other serious injuries. A sniper from Kansas had a grenade go off in his face.  &#10;&#10;On this extraordinary journey, never before seen on film, these soldiers traveled from Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington, D.C., to the small town in southwest France, where in 1858 a peasant girl named Bernadette Soubirous claimed to have dozens of encounters with the Virgin Mary. Some of the soldiers were in wheelchairs, others were being pushed on hospital gurneys. They had already received excellent medical care, but they still longed for something.  &#10;&#10;They needed healing.  &#10;&#10;As Captain Fr. Anselmo Hernandez, Chaplain, U.S. Army, said to me, “What these soldiers have told me is they’re not necessarily looking for that cure but that healing, that internal healing. I usually tell them, when you arrive just be open, allow your heart, your soul, your mind, your spirit to open up to what God has prepared for you.” (To see the complete episode visit www.pbs.org/sacredjourneys.)  &#10;&#10;That sense of openness captures the spirit of many pilgrims. Pilgrimages are never easy. They’re tough physically, they’re tough mentally. And yet when you arrive at the destination, often with a group you’ve bonded with along the way, a pilgrimage can be magical like few gatherings on earth.  &#10;&#10;At a time when organized religion is more threatened than ever, pilgrimages are more popular than ever because they offer pilgrims the chance to experience firsthand some of the most sacred places in the world and decide for themselves what they really believe. They allow pilgrims to escape the ordinary and encounter the extraordinary.  &#10;&#10;It’s a harder way to experience faith, perhaps, but ultimately it can be more fulfilling. And it’s one step in the direction of making religion a viable force in the digital age.  	Pilgrimages are never easy.

203-pleaseaustraliadontletabusiveb	guardian	2015-01-20T01:31:17Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/20/please-australia-dont-let-abusive-boxer-floyd-mayweather-in	Alex McClintock	Please Australia, don't let abusive boxer Floyd Mayweather in	While the boxing world’s attention is focused on whether a fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao might finally happen, Mayweather has announced that he will visit Australia at the end of the month. The world’s best boxer and highest paid athlete won’t be fighting of course, merely making promotional appearances in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.  &#10;&#10;Even leaving aside the disturbing idea that real, living people might pay to see the petulant man known as “Money” do anything other than box, there’s an issue: his extensive history of domestic violence. As Phil Lutton points out, Mayweather has been arrested or cited by police in seven assaults against five different women.  &#10;&#10;Mayweather’s history of domestic violence began in 2001, just a month after dedicating his fight against Diego “Chico” Corrales to “all the battered women in the world.” He allegedly closed a car door on his then-partner Melissa Brim before repeatedly punching her while she lay on the back seat. Not six months later he punched Brim in the neck at a Las Vegas shopping centre. He pleaded guilty and received a suspended sentence.  &#10;&#10;In 2003 Mayweather allegedly punched two friends of his then-partner (and the mother of several of his children) Josie Harris in a nightclub and shook a female security guard. He was issued a citation and found guilty of two counts of battery, though the verdict was vacated and the charges were “dismissed per negotiations.”  &#10;&#10;The same year he allegedly pummelled Harris and dragged her from a car by her hair, though she later dropped the charges and testified that she had lied to police. Mayweather bought Harries a $500,000, 25-carat diamond ring shortly afterwards.  &#10;&#10;In 2011 he finally did jail time (90 days) for savagely beating Harris in front of their children. He might have done many more if he wasn’t a multi- millionaire and a linchpin of the economy in his home state of Nevada.  &#10;&#10;Even boxing fans, who are usually loathe to judge fighters for their conduct outside the ring (few boxers are angels, after all), are unimpressed with Mayweather. And though boxing is a bit of a cultural afterthought these days, comments Mayweather made in support of abuser Ray Rice before his most recent fight focused the attention of the mainstream media on his unsavoury past. Nevertheless, he was unrepentant.  &#10;&#10;Though Mayweather’s criminal past might not automatically disqualify him from receiving an Australian visa, he would have to sit a “character test” on arrival. If you watch the video above, I’m sure you’ll agree that such a test could be a major stumbling block. In a similar case, Australia granted Mike Tyson, who was jailed for rape in 1992, a visa in 2012, though New Zealand did not.  &#10;&#10;So should Australia bar Mayweather? What’s to gain from him visiting? He’s a disgusting, unrepentant assaulter of women and his “I do what I want-ism” is totally undesirable. America might be stuck with him, but I don’t see why we should welcome him and allow him to make money in our country.  &#10;&#10;Last year Australia cancelled the visa of pick up artist Julien Blanc, whose techniques included simulated choking of women in bars, after a social media campaign and protests at venues. There has been nothing simulated about Mayweather’s repeated punching of the women in his life, so I’d imagine he (and the venues that welcome him) can expect the same treatment.  &#10;&#10;On a more selfish note, I simply can’t face the prospect of sections of the Australian media writing seriously about Anthony Mundine fighting Mayweather. Mundine has begun to retweet fans (they are out there) who want him to call Mayweather out. The flow of indistinguishable-from-parody articles has already begun.  &#10;&#10;Please Floyd, concentrate on fighting Manny. We’ll be fine without you. No, really.  	Even boxing fans are questioning the character of serial domestic abuser Floyd Mayweather, who is due to visit Australia this month

Her only relation to Eric Garner, he explained, is that she, too, couldn't breathe after 13 feet of tape was wrapped in at least seven complete turns around her head. She fell into a coma and was pronounced dead four days later.  &#10;&#10;Azelle Rodney, 24, was killed in 2005. He was shot six times within two seconds of police officers ramming the vehicle in which he was travelling. His body was then left on the pavement for 16 hours - not unlike Mike Brown in the streets of Ferguson. Only after nearly 10 years of campaigning led by Rodney's mother, Susan Alexander, is an officer now facing a murder charge.  &#10;&#10;Among those who addressed protesters was Marcia Rigg, the sister of Sean Rigg. He died in police custody at the entrance to Brixton police station in 2008 after a violent arrest. Despite being clearly unwell, he had been handcuffed and left dying on the floor. A police officer, filmed on CCTV, said that he was "faking it".  &#10;&#10;Christopher Alder died while in police custody at Queen's Gardens Police Station in Kingston upon Hull. Having been taken to the station with a head injury, he was unresponsive when he was dragged from a police van. He lay on the floor of the custody suite for 11 minutes, CCTV footage shows, gasping for breath, with his hands cuffed behind him and his trousers round his ankles. A pool of blood formed around his mouth. Instead of being given medical attention, five police officers stood around commenting that he was "right as rain" and his agony was "just a show". They even made monkey noises.  &#10;&#10;Four years earlier in 1994, Shiji Lapite died after being placed in a police van in east London. A post-mortem found that Lapite had died of asphyxiation, suggesting that police officers had used a chokehold. But while the inquest into his death recorded a verdict of unlawful killing, the Crown Prosecution Service declined to prosecute the officers involved.  &#10;&#10;In fact, no officer has been convicted over a death in police custody since 1969, when the two Leeds police officers responsible for the death of David Oluwale, were found guilty of assault.  &#10;&#10;Negative experiences of police treatment are a consistent feature of the lives of many people, especially those who are young, black and come from the working class. Families often suffer not just the initial news of the deaths of their loved ones in custody, but a concerted media campaign from the police smearing the reputations of the victim in the following weeks. The family of Mark Duggan weren't even informed of his death, instead finding out from TV news.  &#10;&#10;And these deaths represent only the worst and most painful cases of police violence. Many "lesser" incidents go virtually unreported. Even when these are recorded - as was a London police officer's threat that "if you say one more fucking word, I'll smash your fucking Arab face in" to a 16-year-old teenager in 2005 - officers never face serious charges.  &#10;&#10;Since the Macpherson report of 1999, which famously pointed to "institutional racism" within the Met, there has been little evidence of structural or far- reaching change in the way the police are held accountable. As in other European countries, especially France, anger at the police in the UK has repeatedly boiled over into riots.  &#10;&#10;The police killing of Duggan in 2011, which sparked the riots of that summer, is the clearest recent case. Eighty-five percent of participants in those riots who were questioned by the Reading the Riots study said policing was an "important" or "very important" factor in why the riots happened.  &#10;&#10;They pointed to long histories of being subjected to humiliating stop-and- searches and beatings by the police, who were often described as operating like a "gang". The common view is that there is little point in attempting recourse via the official police complaint procedures. This was confirmed by a recent investigation by Channel 4 Dispatches, which showed that just one percent of allegations of racism by members of the public against the police in England and Wales were upheld over an eight year period.  &#10;&#10;And yet, despite our knowledge that experiences of police violence have led to riots, the reaction of successive British governments has been to implement ever-harsher policing, especially in black and working-class communities. This coincides with a continued police clampdown in Muslim communities that has generated widespread anger for its methods, including the manufacture of evidence against Muslim suspects and long imprisonment periods for writing Facebook posts.  &#10;&#10;We demonstrated on December 10 not only to show solidarity with those in the US, but also to point to the similar struggles for justice that we are facing here in the UK. In the late evening, dozens of protesters were corralled in the cold for over an hour before being arrested, loaded onto two buses commandeered for the purpose, and driven to various police stations around London. Many were kept in the cold for hours before being led to holding cells. Many were released miles from home in the very early morning.  &#10;&#10;There can be little doubt that this tactic of mass arrests, which is becoming more prominent, is aimed at dissuading future protest. Those arrested are given "interview" dates well into the future - often with stringent bail conditions - and warned about commenting publicly before this date. They are, as such, effectively gagged. There is no small irony in this response to a demonstration about police violence. But we have little intention of remaining silent. After decades of campaigning led by affected families, the movement for police accountability is developing new tactics and involving a growing number of young people who are determined to be the generation that sees change. Along with our friends in the US, we adopt Garner's words to the police as our slogan. This stops today.  	British minorities know all too well about police violence and impunity.&#10;&#10;
205-popefrancissalmanrushdiechar	aljazeera	Sat, 17 Jan 2015 08:20:57 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/01/pope-francis-salman-rushdie-char-20151176461502319.html	Richard Falk	Pope Francis, Salman Rushdie and Charlie Hebdo	There is some common ground, but not much. The killings in Paris last week were horrifying crimes that expose the vulnerability of democratic societies to lethal vigilante violence, whether facilitated from outside or as a spontaneous expression of homegrown psychopathic alienation. Beyond this morbid reality associated with the murder of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists, police officers, and the supermarket hostages, there is nothing but darkness, and in that darkness some additional monsters lurk.  &#10;&#10;We can be thankful once more for the moral clarity of Pope Francis who in the impromptu setting of a plane taking him from Sri Lanka to Manila shined some light on the darkness. Unlike those who so ardently wielded the slogan "Je Suis Charlie", the pope understood that free speech without limits is an invitation to indulge the worst negative impulses that will then operate as viruses destroying the vital organs of the body politic.  &#10;&#10;What Pope Francis underscored was the impossibility of reconciling dignity with hurtful insults. He illustrated his view by saying that if his companion on the plane, Dr Alberto Gazparri, a Vatican official, were to insult Francis' mother, he could expect to be punched. He called such behaviour normal: "It's normal. It's normal. You cannot provoke. You cannot insult the faith of others."  &#10;&#10;Perhaps, this is too strong an expression of limits, but it does indirectly raise the Derrida urgent question of learning to "live together" in peace and with respect within globalising social space.  &#10;&#10;Response to provocation  &#10;&#10;Francis goes on to say that to kill in response to provocation, however severe, is not compatible with religion properly understood. It is behaviour of "deviant forms of religion". He goes on to say "To kill in the name of God is an aberration". At the same time, how lines are drawn with respect to acceptable and unacceptable forms of provocation is highly political and culturally influenced.  &#10;&#10;In one respect, France and other governments understand both sides of this argument, but twist it for political purposes. The popular comedian Dieudonne is being currently prosecuted in France for "defending terrorism" because his humour deeply offends Jews, Zionists, and Israel.  &#10;&#10;There are no less than 54 cases in the country associated with "condoning terrorism". The Associated Press reports that just now "France ordered prosecutors around the country to crack down on hate speech, anti-Semitism, and glorifying terrorism".  &#10;&#10;But note no message by the French government is sent mentioning "hate cartooning" or addressing the surge of "Islamophobia" in the country in the days following the January 7 attack on the Charlie Hebdo editorial offices. A large number of mosques in France and elsewhere in Europe have been desecrated in the last week.  &#10;&#10;This kind of double standards performs a variety of insidious functions for the French state. It uses the language of "terrorism" to demonise its political enemies and "free speech" to immunise its political friends. It merges the criminalisation of anti-Semitism with strong criticisms of Israel along with any advocacy of boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS). And it makes it even clearer to Muslims that they are fair game for Islamophobes and xenophobes. In effect, a French political community is being upheld that seeks to include Jews as valued and protected members while reinforcing the Muslim understanding that their residences and social standing can be fully understood by reference to the no-go banilieus of the country.  &#10;&#10;Salman Rushdie's ordeals  &#10;&#10;In the wake of these events, there is a new sympathetic look back at the ordeals of Salman Rushdie endured after the publication of his satirical novel "The Satanic Verses" in 1988. Rushdie, appearing as a guest on Bill Maher's talk show and delivering a lecture at the University of Vermont, understandably defended freedom of expression as an absolute right.  &#10;&#10;His words, deeply felt, are worth heeding as the counterpoint to the views expressed by Pope Francis: "And so artists who ... push outwards often find very powerful forces pushing back. They find the forces of silence opposing the forces of speech. The forces of censorship against the forces of utterance ... At that boundary is that push-and-pull between more and less. And that push and pull can be very dangerous to the artist. And many artists have suffered terribly for that."  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;The context of Rushdie's recent remarks was the Charlie Hebdo incident, but his outlook was intended to be sweeping in its generality. And yet he did not, nor did Bill Maher, pause to take note of those powerful forces in the West that have tried to shut down critics of Israel by shouting "anti-Semite" at the top of their lungs. Without some degree of consistency it is difficult to consider clearly the societal choice at stake.  &#10;&#10;What makes this confrontation so difficult to resolve is that it engages two truths, not one. The beginning of ethical credibility is to insist upon consistency. Either Rushdie and France have to abide by the unsavoury views of Dieudonne as well as those of Charlie Hebdo or it should suppress them both.  &#10;&#10;If it allows both then it is opting for the Rushdie view that members of a modern society must learn to live with the extremes of cultural freedom even if hurtful. If it allows neither then it is choosing to protect the sensibilities of minorities and others whose dignity is under attack. Of course, there are many compromises that can be made to ensure maximum freedom of expression while acknowledging certain limits.  &#10;&#10;The US Supreme Court long ago decided that free speech does entitle someone to yell "fire" in a crowded theatre. This is what courts are for, to draw these lines in specific cases, balancing opposing truths in the light of practicality and the evolving values of the community. What a judicial body had to say about race or homosexuality a century ago is different than what it says today. And as we in the US know too well, the prevailing ideology among the justices is often of greater importance to determining how such lines are drawn than are the legislative or constitutional enactments being interpreted. In some respects, then, such determinations are more part of the problem than of the solution.  &#10;&#10;Abstract sentiments  &#10;&#10;I find myself siding with the abstract sentiments of Pope Francis, but with Rushdie's view of minimising the role of law and the state. In this respect, if we impose limits by way of government we are entering the domain of censorship. At the same time, we need to protect individuals and groups against malicious forms of defamation and hateful attacks on identities without confusing such protection with efforts to channel public awareness in certain prescribed directions.  &#10;&#10;My own experience suggests that "freedom" of this sort has been used by some pro-Zionist and pro-Israeli organisations to discredit and deter and criticism of Israel, and especially of Israeli state crimes victimising the Palestinian people. In Rushdie's case we need to protect his right to publish "The Satanic Verses", while condemning the fatwa imposing a death sentence for blasphemy and apostasy, yet upholding the right of non-western political communities to prohibit distribution of such a book because of its provocative nature in certain civilisational settings.  &#10;&#10;Obviously, there are no cookie cutter answers. The proper limits are a matter of history, ethics, cultural priorities, and circumstances. I feel that the central question is raised by Derrida's inquiry into how we can learn to live together. For me, living together, given the originality of our historical moment, involves the construction of overlapping political communities of destiny - from family to world, with a major focus on the national political community combined with a greater effort to establish a global political community so that challenges posed by climate change, nuclear weaponry, infectious disease, and world poverty can be addressed more effectively and humanely.  	There are many compromises that can be made to ensure maximum freedom of&#10;expression while acknowledging certain limits.&#10;&#10;
206-popefrancisvaticanjustgavedemo	foxnews	2014-12-17T22:33:39Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/12/17/pope-francis-vatican-just-gave-democrats-big-boost-for-2016/	Adam Shaw	Pope Francis’ Vatican just gave Democrats a big boost for 2016	Sept. 17, 2014: Vice President Joe Biden speaks to a Catholic nun during the kickoff of the Nuns on the Bus at the Statehouse in Des Moines, Iowa. (AP)  &#10;&#10;A bombshell Vatican report released Monday that gives a green light to the social activism of left-wing U.S. nuns is the latest example of how the more liberal papacy of Pope Francis could affect the outcome of the 2016 US elections.  &#10;&#10;The report forms the conclusion of an investigation, known as an “Apostolic Visitation,” into the practices and beliefs of sisters across the U.S. that was launched in 2008 under the papacy of Pope Benedict XVI amid long-standing concerns that many orders had lost their way.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Although there are a significant number of vibrant orthodox orders, such as the pro-life Sisters of Life, the Dominican Sisters of St. Cecilia and the Little Sisters of the Poor (who are currently fighting the ObamaCare contraception mandate), a much larger number of orders have rejected Catholic doctrines on the divinity of Christ, on sacramental theology and on moral issues such as abortion, contraception and gay marriage.  &#10;&#10;Instead they substituted in alternative, non-Christian forms of spirituality that rejected fundamental Catholic truths, accompanied by a turn toward aggressively partisan left-wing social activism.  &#10;&#10;What was being investigated was on show in 2012, with a group of left-wing nuns forming a slick national campaign called the “Nuns on the Bus,” campaigning against the proposed Ryan budget plan. Last year their tour topic was another Democrat favorite -- amnesty for illegal immigrants.  &#10;&#10;Heading up the travelling sisters is Sr. Simone Campbell -- a lawyer and lobbyist who also led the nuns who defied the US bishops’ condemnation of ObamaCare, signed a letter supporting the law and attended the signing ceremony at which she received a hug from President Obama.  &#10;&#10;At that time, the power of the “Nuns on the Bus” was limited by their designation as rebels. With a Vatican investigation under way, it made it difficult for the nuns to claim to be the authentic moral voice of Catholicism.  &#10;&#10;However, since then, Pope Francis has taken over and brought with him a certain interpretation of Catholic social teaching which adheres a lot closer to the tenets of the Democratic Party than more universally acknowledged truths pushed by Popes Benedict XVI and John Paul II.  &#10;&#10;The results of the probe will no doubt invite speculation that Pope Francis has had heavy influence over the findings of the report, which can comfortably be described as a whitewash.  &#10;&#10;The report mentions nothing of the “secularist mentality” and radical feminism that had been given as the reason for the launch of the investigation, and is mostly a document of praise which offers little-to-no criticism, no disciplinary action and says the nuns’ work resonates with Pope Francis’ emphasis on social justice  &#10;&#10;The report even manages to take a swipe at the U.S. economy, praising the nuns for working in an economy that too often “creates inequity and exclusion.” It is better than anything the liberal nuns could have hoped for.  &#10;&#10;The liberal orders aren’t out of the woods yet. A separate investigation by the Vatican’s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith into the Leadership Conference of Women Religious (LCWR) -- a coalition of predominantly left-wing orders -- is not complete, and the doctrinal watchdog is likely to find something in a group that prides itself in rebelling against Church teaching.  &#10;&#10;However, Monday’s report gives left-wing nuns, and the Democratic Party a big boost for 2016.  &#10;&#10;The Catholic vote has been decisive in modern U.S. politics, and Catholic Democrats have often hyped their faith around election time. Joe Biden in particular has stood up as the advocate for liberal nuns, recently attending a “Nuns on the Bus” rally and in the past reportedly telling Pope Benedict XVI that he was being too hard on them and that he should “lighten up.”  &#10;&#10;With a recent Vatican synod appearing to undermine Church teaching on controversial issues, the new report is another blow to more traditional Catholics who, when the radical nuns are talking, have always been able to point out their status as rebels and dissenters ignoring Church teaching.  &#10;&#10;Unless the CDF does a dramatic about-face with its report, the Democrats’ favorite nuns will now claim to have Vatican approval. With a green light from Rome, expect left-wing nuns and the Democrat Party to be emboldened in their push to present the nuns -- and the Democrats -- as the authentic voice of Catholicism, putting the Democrats in a better position to retain and expand upon the often-decisive Catholic vote in 2016.  	A bombshell Vatican released Monday that gives a green light to the social&#10;activism of left-wing U.S. nuns is the latest example of how the more liberal&#10;papacy of Pope Francis could affect the outcome of the 2016 US elections.&#10;&#10;
207-powerwithoutpurposedavidcamero	guardian	2015-01-06T20:00:00Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/06/power-without-purpose-david-cameron-prime-minister-general-election	Rafael Behr	Power without purpose: the tragic rule of David Cameron	When the history of David Cameron’s time as prime minister is written, no doctrine will be named after him. The government has been ideological, but not in a way that bears an intellectual imprint of the Conservative leader. There have been upheavals in schools, the health service and the benefits system, but those revolutions belong to Michael Gove, Andrew Lansley and Iain Duncan Smith. Cameron gave permission, he never pioneered.  &#10;&#10;Cameron has also said he abhors “isms” and wouldn’t want posterity to anoint him with one. Friends say this makes him a practical conservative of the old school, guided by ancient and uncodified British instincts of decency. His enemies think that is a posh way of saying he lacks principle.  &#10;&#10;With no pattern of belief associated with his name, Cameron’s legacy will be a collection of tactical manoeuvres, with as many prominent surrenders as victories. The true spirit of “Cameronism” in education, for example, is better conveyed in the removal in 2014 of Gove to placate the teaching profession than in his appointment to shake up the department in the first place.  &#10;&#10;But in no field is the Tory leader’s trademark better defined than in his approach to Europe. If any political manoeuvre deserves to be named after the Conservative leader, it is the habit of trying to sate the appetites of hardline Eurosceptics with morsels that would always leave them hungry. It might be called the “Cameron concession”. Thus has he fed the Eurosceptic pack enough to keep it snapping at his heels and frustrated it enough that his voice was drowned by angry barking.  &#10;&#10;Perhaps the saddest aspect of this spectacle is that it saw a potentially sound policy trampled in the melee. The outline of Cameron’s position is that Britain should stay in the EU but under changed terms. They will change anyway because the priority for most other member states is bolstering the single currency. This involves the integration of a euro-core with serious implications for Britain’s status one way or another. So the principle of pro- active renegotiation, ratified by referendum, is sound.  &#10;&#10;But Cameron spoiled a plausible position with cowardice: he set his renegotiation up as an empty vessel into which hardliners poured Ukip-ish fantasies of ending immigration. He bought the argument that says the terms on offer from Brussels get better the closer Britain gets to the exit, although that logic is commonly advanced by people who want the negotiations to fail. The deadline for his referendum, the end of 2017, was plucked from thin air without regard for what was diplomatically feasible or economically wise.  &#10;&#10;But the chief reason Cameron’s EU policy hasn’t worked for him is that voters also consider motive when awarding merit. Those who want a referendum in order to leave the EU mistrust the prime minister because he wants a different outcome; and pro-Europeans don’t trust Cameron to defend Britain’s interests in Europe because the whole policy came about as a sop to the sceptics. That doesn’t leave many people who think the Tories have the right policy for the right reason.  &#10;&#10;Europe exemplifies the problem, but it runs deeper. Cameron’s team are sure they are running on an admirable record: economic growth, rising employment, lower crime, a reduced deficit and reformed welfare. These are things, like the EU referendum, that should make the Tories popular. By the same calculation, Labour, lacking those credentials, should be out of the running. Yet the campaign has started and Ed Miliband is still ahead.  &#10;&#10;Downing Street clings to the now familiar explanation that voters haven’t properly engaged with the choice, and that the Tory surge will come at the eleventh hour when the reality of a possible Miliband regime penetrates the national consciousness. But what if Cameron has hit the limit of credit available for five years in charge because even the good bits don’t connect in people’s minds with decent motives?  &#10;&#10;That is what Labour strategists are banking on. Miliband’s personal ratings are bleak, except on measures of decency and empathy. So those are the leadership qualities his campaign aims to project. The contrast they want to draw is between Cameron’s ethical plasticity and a challenger who sticks to his beliefs. Miliband will be cast as a man guided by what David Axelrod, Barack Obama’s former aide now advising Labour, calls “a north star” – a compass point that tells voters a leader is propelled by something more noble than the salvation of his own skin. Waverers who don’t warm to Miliband (and who aren’t irredeemably riddled with anti-Westminster rage) might still be persuaded that he is in politics for the right reason.  &#10;&#10;The opposite is true of Cameron. Even those in his own party who like the direction of policy cannot sincerely claim that their leader is driven by much beyond a sense of entitlement to the job. That was less of an impediment in the past. For much of the 20th century, Britain was ruled by Conservatives who thought of political theory as something suspect or vulgar, a folly for continentals and socialists, and no substitute for the innate good sense drilled into English boys at the best schools.  &#10;&#10;The Thatcher revolution disrupted the patrician culture in the Conservative party, but not the underlying belief that Tory rule is a default setting for British politics; the norm to which the country tends. That assumption, more than economic growth, deficit reduction, an EU referendum or any other part of the prospectus, is what makes Cameron think he can stay on after May. It is the confidence that he is an archetypal prime minister and the only credible candidate for the job. Perhaps he will be proved right. He will have money and much of the press to amplify that view. But even loyal Conservatives can’t entirely ignore the intellectual void at the centre. The right has decried it as often as the left.  &#10;&#10;The past five years have posed huge challenges for Britain regarding the economy, our place in Europe, England’s relations with Scotland, the decline of trust in institutions. But of which encounter with a great problem can it be said the prime minister truly rose to the occasion? Cameron doesn’t have big answers, he shrinks questions. And that is how history will remember him, whatever happens in May. He successfully pursued power and spent it without purpose.  	Rafael Behr: The prime minister rose without ideological trace. Whatever the election result, he seems likely to disappear the same way

The presidency of Barack Obama will be over, and to the joy and relief of many Americans, there will be a new beginning. To quote President Obama’s 2008 campaign slogan “Hope and Change” will be the order of the day.  &#10;&#10;Certainly “change” will come with the new occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The certainty of who that man or woman will be two years from now is unknown. It will depend on who can survive the already begun long campaign that will easily be the most expensive in history.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Immediately after the oath of Office is taken at noon on January 20th, 2017 on the West Portal of the Capitol, the pictures on the walls of the White House and the personal artifacts of Barack Obama and his family will be removed.  &#10;&#10;The legacy left behind and the permanent White House staff will stay on awaiting the new leader of the free world.  &#10;&#10;“Hope” is always in the minds of Americans along with good will for any new president. Much of that good will and almost all of the “hope,” that this president could or would be different, is gone.  &#10;&#10;With a little more than half of the president’s second term remaining, judgments have been made and speculation is rampant that the White House decisions are now being made is to define that legacy.  &#10;&#10;His expected veto decision on the Keystone pipeline is to appease the environmentalists.  &#10;&#10;His executive orders allowing millions of illegals to stay in the country rather than be deported is also viewed as a pandering to the fastest growing voting group.  &#10;&#10;His alteration by executive order creating changes in his health care law have enraged members of Congress that have the real power to change laws.  &#10;&#10;His attempt to close Guantanamo prison over the objections of Congress is another critical debate.But the biggest and most long lasting mistake maybe his withdrawal of ground troops from both Iraq and Afghanistan. And one he has not yet made may be more severe and dangerous to world peace -- his headlong rush toward an attempt to get a nuclear deal with Iran. A deal that, in spite of all the reassurances from Secretary of State John Kerry, will enable Iran to make nuclear weapons.  &#10;&#10;The mainstream media is feeding into this legacy debate. One of the latest examples, The New York magazine cover story of January 11, called the “Obama History Project.”  &#10;&#10;The magazine asked 53 historians to weigh in on Barack Obama’s legacy and how they think he will be measured 20 years from now.  &#10;&#10;Historians play a vital role in measuring presidents. Usually their histories are written decades after the fact when they can go back and review documents and gather facts and see the results of presidential actions from afar and in a cold dissected view.  &#10;&#10;Historians have certainly altered the view of many former presidents and have actually restored the reputations of a few. Harry Truman being a perfect example. A man greatly respected today, Truman left office with a tattered reputation, was very unpopular with the public, and could not possibly been reelected when he left office in 1952. Today, he is ranked among the top 10 presidents by most presidential scholars.  &#10;&#10;A review of Eisenhower is going on now and his marks are high. Lyndon Johnson and George Herbert Walker Bush are getting favorable reviews by the historians after being out of office for decades.  &#10;&#10;I am a partisan Republican who has worked in the administrations of three presidents and served two tours of duty at the highest level of Ronald Reagan’s White House.  &#10;&#10;As an American and as the father of a young college-aged daughter, I don’t want any president to fail. I want this country to be led by the very best people we can find.  &#10;&#10;It isn’t always so. Every president, or people on his staff are looking out for his legacy. But the boss I worked for, President Reagan, operated under a different theory.  &#10;&#10;One day we were returning from a trip out somewhere in the country. We were flying aboard Marine One, the presidential helicopter, across Washington, after leaving Air Force One at Andrews Air Base.  &#10;&#10;The president was very tired and as we landed on the South Lawn, he looked up at pictures of his ranch displayed on the walls of the chopper. He said, pointing to the ranch pictures, "I wish we were landing there!”  &#10;&#10;Not knowing what to say to the leader of the free world who obviously didn’t want to go back to work. I said, “Mr. President, it will all be worthwhile. History will be very kind to you someday."  &#10;&#10;He chuckled and said right back. “Ed, I don’t care about history. I am going to be dead and gone and they will distort it anyways. What I care about is those great young people we saw out there today and making sure they have the same opportunities we all had.”  &#10;&#10;He turned to his closest friend, also sitting there, Senator Paul Laxalt (R.-Nev.). He said Paul’s father was a Basque immigrant sheepherder and his mother a hotel cook.  &#10;&#10;He turned to me and said: “Your dad was shipyard worker and my own father was a travelling shoe salesman. We are all here because this great country gave us opportunities. We have to make sure that’s what we leave behind and those kids out there get those same opportunities. Now let’s get back in there and go to work!”  &#10;&#10;Ronald Reagan loved this country and was proud to be the leader of the greatest group of people in the world.  &#10;&#10;President Obama, that’s how you build a legacy!  &#10;&#10;President Obama\'s life story is one of inspiration. To come from a broken home, abandoned by his father as an infant, to be raised by grandparents from the Midwest and to achieve, as a black man, the highest office in the land is inspirational. Unfortunately, he has not been an inspirational president.  &#10;&#10;Mr. Obama, let me speak to you directly. Right now your legacy is that your party suffered historic losses across the country at every level in 2014.  &#10;&#10;Your health care plan will cost enormous sums above your estimates and even those who didn’t have health insurance and now do, can’t get health care.  &#10;&#10;The Dodd-Frank bill has cost American business billions of dollars and thousands of lawyers are working around the clock to deal with the implementation of it.  &#10;&#10;You pulled our troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan before the job was done. And your lack of strength as a leader has made the strongest nation in the world look weak and vulnerable.  &#10;&#10;You have the greatest political tin ear I\'ve ever seen in a president. Someone should have told you to take your place at the front of the line with other world leaders in Sunday\'s million person march in Paris, against worldwide terrorism. Or you should have known yourself. Yes, Mr. President, they are terrorists and they hate everything we stand for.  &#10;&#10;You want a legacy? Work with the Congress the American people chose and get something done!  	With a little more than half the President’s second term remaining, judgments&#10;have been made and speculation is rampant that the White House decisions are&#10;now being made is to define that legacy.&#10;&#10;
209-privatisingmexicooilindustr	aljazeera	Tue, 30 Dec 2014 01:10:17 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/privatising-mexico-oil-industr-2014123081138239573.html	Edgardo Buscaglia	Privatising Mexico's oil industry spells disaster	Considering Mexico's history and the present political context, it's no surprise that the majority of the Mexican population nowadays is either deeply suspicious of President Pena Nieto or just opposed to the current fast-track drive to privatise oil and pass it into the hands of foreign oligopolies.  &#10;&#10;At present, Mexico suffers from an extremely weak state where the vast majority of crimes go unaddressed because of a judicial vacuum. More than 22,000 forced disappearances have occurred since 2007 and more than 70,000 people have been killed since 2006. Almost every week we hear about more mass graves discovered. Most recently, a massacre of students in Iguala shook the nation.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;Mexico also suffers from the third largest illicit economy in the world, according to the Global Financial Integrity Report. Clearly, organised crime is openly challenging and fragmenting the state. In the face of these facts even President Nieto has admitted in public speeches that Mexico's legal system is in shambles.  &#10;&#10;International experience and basic common sense indicate that a country must possess a minimum standard of the rule of law in order to be able to foster social benefits for most of its population when privatising state assets.  &#10;&#10;Without functional regulatory and judicial controls, it is technically and politically not feasible for any oil-funded social development fund to effectively spread wealth to future generations through new public education programmes, a modernised public health, adequate environmental standards and a much-improved physical infrastructure.  &#10;&#10;Absolutely nothing today indicates that Mexico can implement privatisation of the oil infrastructure at even the most basic standards of security, transparency, effectiveness and efficiency.  &#10;&#10;Yet, a Mexican paradox occurs. While insecurity still runs at record highs, foreign money keeps pouring in. What's going on? Since the beginning of the still unfinished democratic transition and since the economic opening to international trade of the early 1990s, Mexico managed to attract billions of dollars per year in foreign direct investment. Yet, most of this money has been channelled into politically managed non-competitive sectors in the hands of Mexican "state courtesans" disguised as private entrepreneurs who over the last 25 years created vast oligopolies out of the privatisation of state assets.  &#10;&#10;The privatisation process in Mexico has largely been conducted through dubious procedures orchestrated by corrupt federal governments. All this happened in the midst of a Mexican economy lacking technological innovation with low productivity and where more than half of what is produced and consumed is exchanged within informal/illicit markets.  &#10;&#10;Nevertheless, these so-called private oligopolies within the mining, banking and telecommunications industries operate in a crony capitalistic fashion by attracting foreign investors to politically protected markets in which governments (through bribes and subsidies) ensure rates of return two to five times above the international average. How can, for example, German or US oligopolies presently investing in Mexico fail to fall in love with such a "generous" corrupt system?  &#10;&#10;The forthcoming Mexican oil privatisation falls comfortably within this "legally corrupt" economic framework.  &#10;&#10;Yet, harsh social realities have a way of trumping politics most of the time. Mexican writer and journalist Ana Lilia Perez published in 2012 a book titled "The Black Cartel" in which she provides a description of massive organised crime infiltration within the top managerial echelons of the state-run oil company, PEMEX.  &#10;&#10;The nature of the organised crime infiltration covers technical and political appointees at PEMEX. Moreover, with thorough documentation, Ms Perez provides a detailed account of how and where a large portion of the oil extracted and distributed by PEMEX is currently stolen through illegal operations.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;These have been linked to Mexican politicians and US and Mexican private companies selling illegal Mexican oil to the markets in Canada, Mexico and the US, with the complicity of the Mexican armed forces supposedly responsible for protecting the PEMEX infrastructure.  &#10;&#10;The current illegal oil trafficking comes with high-level political corruption, intense armed conflict causing thousands of deaths per month and frequent acts of terrorism against the PEMEX infrastructure. One cannot expect this armed conflict scenario to just go away after privatisation.  &#10;&#10;In this kind of context, any honest foreign investor bidding within a Mexican oil privatisation process should have his or her head checked or otherwise possess enough political clout within Mexico or the financial capacity to bribe with millions of dollars the government ladder and pay for a vast praetorian guard of security personnel to manage the armed chaos ahead. In comparison, dealing with other oil producing countries with problematic states, such as Nigeria, would seem like a walk in the park.  &#10;&#10;Shareholders of oil companies can only expect low economic returns and chaos from investing in the Mexican oil sector, unless, prior to any private investment drive, an international judicial cooperation effort starts dismantling the vast organised crime networks within the Mexican oil business and beyond. This international judicial cooperation must entail the actual implementation of a serious anti-corruption programme within the Mexican state with much broader conflict of interest and traffic of influence statutes, all monitored by reputable international civil society organisations.  &#10;&#10;Furthermore, the failure of the Mexican state needs to be corrected with the installation of autonomous investigative units for economic crimes within each Mexican region and the creation of witness protection programmes for cases of political corruption linked to organised crime. These reforms will be good for Mexican society in general and also good for the pockets of Mexican and foreign oil investors.  	In the absence of strong state institutions, the privatisation of Mexico's oil&#10;industry will be disastrous.&#10;&#10;
210-putinand2015timeforimfinrussia	foxnews	2015-01-06T21:19:05Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/01/06/putin-and-2015-time-for-imf-in-russia/	Desmond Lachman 	Putin and 2015: Time for the IMF in Russia	  &#10;&#10;The last thing a beleaguered Vladimir Putin will want to hear is that Russia has now reached the stage where it desperately needs an IMF-supported economic adjustment program. Without such a program, it is difficult to see how Russia can regain domestic and international confidence in the management of its economy. Absent the IMF, it is also difficult to see how Russia will be able to avoid the imposition of damaging capital controls on its economy.  &#10;&#10;There can be no denying that Russian policymakers were totally blindsided by the collapse in international oil prices from around $110 a barrel in midsummer to $50 a barrel at present. All too likely this will prove to have been a very costly lapse in economic policy judgment, particularly considering that energy accounts for around two-thirds of Russian exports and around half of its tax revenues.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;A dramatic drop in international oil prices would have been difficult for Russia in normal times, but these are hardly normal times for Russia, since effective financial sanctions are being imposed on it in the context of the ongoing Ukrainian crisis. Those sanctions have precipitated more than $100 billion in capital flight from Russia since the start of this year. They are also seriously restricting the ability of Russian corporations to refinance their large U.S. dollar debts coming due.  &#10;&#10;In responding to a burgeoning balance of payments crisis, Russian policymakers appear to have made every mistake in the book. The central bank was painfully slow to use its large international reserves or interest rate policy to calm market fears about the currency’s stability. Compounding matters, the central bank has managed to convey the impression that the Russian government stands fully behind the Russian corporate sector’s more than $600 billion in foreign currency debt.  &#10;&#10;Worse yet, the central bank’s actions have not been backed up by any serious adjustment to the government’s spending plans, despite the fact that the oil price now is around 50 percent below the level assumed in the government’s budget. Similarly, there have been no proposals to reform the insidious interconnection between the government and the corporate sectors, which has seriously undermined confidence in the management of the economy.  &#10;&#10;With the government seemingly at sea, the Russian ruble, has lost almost half of its value since the start of the year. This is something that Russia can ill-afford, considering that inflation is already over 9 percent and that the Russian people are all too familiar with the pain associated with very high inflation rates.  &#10;&#10;The public is already starting to hoard groceries before they get more expensive, and people are rushing to their ATMs while the going is still good. It would seem to be only a matter of time before they start running on their banks.  &#10;&#10;Experience amply suggests that it is very hard to regain economic confidence once it has been lost. The countries in Russia’s dire economic circumstances that have succeeded have done so in the context of a carefully coordinated economic adjustment program that had the imprimatur of an outside independent agency like the IMF.  &#10;&#10;For Vladimir Putin to successfully approach the IMF, he would have to back down on his Ukrainian adventure to win Western support.  &#10;&#10;Considering that to be highly unlikely, Russians should brace themselves for a rough economic ride next year. For not only is it all too likely that Russia will experience a deep economic recession and double-digit inflation. It will also be subjected to capital controls that will further distort Russia’s already highly distorted economy.  	Absent the IMF, it is also difficult to see how Russia will be able to avoid&#10;the imposition of damaging capital controls on its economy.&#10;&#10;
211-putinandukraineexpectmorebruta	foxnews	2015-01-15T21:07:47Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/01/15/putin-and-ukraine-expect-more-brutal-aggression-from-russia-desperate-leader/	Leon Aron	Putin and Ukraine: Expect more brutal aggression from Russia's desperate leader	  &#10;&#10;The renewal of fighting this week over the Donetsk airport in Eastern Ukraine– an important symbolic target for Russian proxy fighters—should come as no surprise. The U.S. and Western Europe should expect even more extensive Russia-directed attacks.  &#10;&#10;Why? Because of the choice Vladimir Putin made five years ago, confirmed on his reelection in 2012 – and is continuing to make. After Russia’s GDP plunged by almost 8 percent during the 2008-9 world financial crisis, there was a virtual consensus among Russian economists that Putin’s economic model, which depended on the redistribution of revenues from ever-increasing oil prices, along with growing state control over the economy and rampant corruption, was nearly exhausted.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Russia needed to “modernize and diversify,” as the catch words among such thinkers went. But to do so, the country first and foremost had to “improve the investment climate.”  &#10;&#10;That was a euphemism for tapering off the state’s grip on the economy; getting rid of bureaucratic shakedowns of private businesses; ensuring that courts were no longer for sale or open to “instructions” from authorities; strengthening private property rights; and eventually decentralizing and liberalizing the political system.  &#10;&#10;In short, deep institutional reforms. These were advocated by, among others, Alexei Kudrin, Putin’s personal friend and confidant, former finance minister and former first deputy prime minister.  &#10;&#10;Kudrin was to be a disappointed man. While paying lip service to “modernization,” the Kremlin did nothing to advance that agenda.  &#10;&#10;Two years later, Russia was shaken by pro-democracy, anti-Putin demonstrations in all of Russia’s largest cities.  &#10;&#10;Putin got the same message that almost every authoritarian leader gets sooner or later: reform and democratize to improve the economy or tighten the screws of repression to deal with discontent.  &#10;&#10;We all know what Putin did. Upon his presidential reelection in 2012, he issued a slew of laws constraining already limited freedoms of public protest and speech.  &#10;&#10;The consequences came quickly: even with oil prices over $100 per bbl., growth dwindled to a crawl and capital flight reached record levels.  &#10;&#10;By the end of 2013, Putin’s popularity was at lowest point in 13 years. Around half of Russians did not want to see him as president again in 2018.  &#10;&#10;Yet Putin doubled down once more, using another tried-and-true authoritarian tool: manufactured nationalist patriotic frenzy mixed with paranoia and served up by deafening propaganda.  &#10;&#10;The anti-corruption, pro-European revolution in Ukraine was presented as an American plot against Russia. Following the annexation of Crimea in March 2014, those who opposed the regime were labelled the “fifth column” and “national traitors.”  &#10;&#10;Then came war in Ukraine -- aggression by proxy or, last fall, by uniformed Russian troops.  &#10;&#10;The daily poisoning of Russian hearts and minds on state-controlled national television is now beginning to surpass even Soviet totalitarianism. Western democracies are portrayed as Russia’s mortal enemies, who seek to undermine Moscow’s sovereignty and enslave its people.  &#10;&#10;This Stalinist-style propaganda is designed to justify the Kremlin’s aggression against Ukraine, excuse increasing domestic repression, explain away mounting economic hardships and-- most troubling—perhaps prepare the country for possible aggression against other neighbors.  &#10;&#10;Both in his end-of-year press-conference and in his New Year’s message to the nation, Putin fixed the propaganda pitch to the highest point:  &#10;&#10;“We are defending our independence, our sovereignty and our right to exist,” he declared. “We need to accomplish, to realize all that we planned – for ourselves, for the sake of our children, and for the sake of Russia.”  &#10;&#10;After this, can anyone expect the Russian commander-in-chief to go wobbly on foreign enemies or to abandon ethnic “brethren” fighting against an allegedly genocidal “Nazi junta”— known to the rest of the world as the elected government in Kiev?  &#10;&#10;U.S. and European diplomats keep talking about providing Russia with an “off ramp.” Judging by Putin’s rhetoric, there is no ramp high enough for the task.  &#10;&#10;So long as Putin sticks with the anti-reform choice, escalation appears to be his only tactic for staying in and consolidating power.  &#10;&#10;This choice preceded the drop in oil prices and Western sanctions – and it will outlive them as well. The West should expect no magic turn-around and prepare to confront but also engage with this Russia over the long haul.  	The renewal of fighting this week over the Donetsk airport in Eastern Ukraine–&#10;an important symbolic target for Russian proxy fighters—should come as no&#10;surprise. The U.S. and Western Europe should expect even more extensive&#10;Russia-directed attacks.&#10;&#10;

The fate of the multibillion dollar project had been up in the air for a few months. Breaching EU competition rules, the pipeline project could have gone through if it had allowed access to suppliers other than Gazprom. The crisis in Ukraine and the mounting tensions gave EU policymakers an additional reason not to accommodate Russia's demands for special treatment.  &#10;&#10;As a result, Putin declared that resources will be directed towards upgrading gas pipeline infrastructure linking Russia to Turkey - or even building an altogether new pipeline, in an attempt to save face and offset the losses incurred over South Stream.  &#10;&#10;This decision underscores the pragmatism in the way Moscow and Ankara deal with each other. Meetings and official phone conversations between Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, more than 35 over the past few years, usually follow a very similar script. The two leaders agree to disagree on the ongoing human tragedy in Syria, where they sit on opposing sides, and proceed with bilateral business.  &#10;&#10;This time around, they made the usual pledge to triple the volume of trade between the two countries from the current figure of $33bn to $100bn by the end of this decade. That might be an ambitious target but one should not forget that Russia is already Turkey's second largest trading partner after Germany. It is, furthermore, the second biggest market for Russian gas exports outside the former Soviet Union, with Germany again the frontrunner.  &#10;&#10;Turkish construction firms have carved out a niche in the Russian market, benefiting handsomely from large public-funded project such as the Sochi Winter Olympics. This explains why Erdogan was deaf to calls for Turks of Circassian origin to boycott the games, which were set in the part of the Caucasus they were uprooted from back in the 1860s.  &#10;&#10;Currently, there is a problem with gas deliveries over the Trans-Balkan pipeline to western Turkey via Ukraine, Moldova, Romania and Bulgaria, because of disruptions due to the constant wrangling between Gazprom and Ukraine's Naftohaz. If the winter is harsh, heating in Istanbul and other large cities in the Marmara region will suffer. That is not a welcome prospect for the Turkish government, which is heading for general elections in the first half of 2015 and is therefore determined to avoid such unpleasant shocks and also keep gas prices low.  &#10;&#10;High-ranking Russian representatives, including Gazprom's CEO Alexei Miller, who was in Ankara last week, promise to step up volumes through the Blue Stream, the pipeline connecting the Russian grid to central Anatolia via the Black Sea, and reach a total of 30 billion cubic metres in 2014, from 25.6 billion cubic metres the previous year. In this context, it makes perfect sense that investment should be redirected from the botched South Stream project to the upgrade of Blue Stream.  &#10;&#10;In the long run, Ankara would also like to move away from dependence on Russia and tap into new gas flowing from Azerbaijan - via the Trans Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP) coming onstream in 2019 - Northern Iraq, Iran and, should a solution be reached on the Cyprus Issue, the Eastern Mediterranean. The AKP government has helped decrease imports from Russia to 57 percent of the overall volume, but in absolute terms, consumption in an expanding economy like Turkey's is only going higher. Luckily, the plummeting prices of oil have come as a huge bonus to the government, reducing Turkey's bill and improving the balance of payments vis-a-vis Russia.  &#10;&#10;What Turkey is offering in exchange is neutrality in Putin's confrontation with the West. Ankara has a lot of reasons to be unhappy about the annexation of Crimea, home to a large Tatar community which views Turkey as a kin state, and about the frozen conflict in Eastern Ukraine. Yet, unlike all other members of NATO, it has declined to join the sanctions imposed on Russia (imports of Turkish poultry and seafood have rocketed since).  &#10;&#10;The strategic value of Turkey's neutrality has only gone up after Putin found himself shouldered aside by most emerging powers at the recent G20 summit in Brisbane, Australia. Russia has long encouraged Turkey's pursuit of an autonomous foreign policy and emancipation from NATO and the US. As the Turkish city of Antalya hosts the next G20 summit, there will be a renewed emphasis on Turkey's transformation into a global leader rather than a pliant western periphery.  &#10;&#10;But geopolitical gains may not give Russia sufficient incentive to accommodate Turkish demands. Putin came with a delegation of 10 government ministers and a shopping list too. He would like to see progress on Rosatom's $20bn project to build Turkey's first nuclear power station at Akkuyu near Mersin. Construction work is expected to start in May, but reportedly Putin has insisted on a preferential treatment for the Russian state company by the Turkish tax authorities. It seems, however, that Erdogan has held his ground this time around and Rosatom has not obtained what it wanted.  &#10;&#10;Though Putin's visit will be remembered for the South Stream announcement, what is most remarkable about it is the continued development of Russian- Turkish relations, amid mounting tensions between Putin and the West.  	Hard-nosed pragmatism continues to govern relations between Russia and Turkey.&#10;&#10;

There they would rush around madly, imagining themselves to be bunking off, but not realising how much history, science and art they would quietly be soaking up.  &#10;&#10;By lunchtime they’d be a bit confused about what’s up or down, or good or bad. They’d learn that it wasn’t as much fun as it seems to work as a servant at Downton Abbey, and conversely that life in a grim Victorian factory could be better than life as a Georgian farm worker. They would discover that Britons may have refused to be slaves, but still owned an awful lot of them. They would find out that in a medieval community you would walk everywhere, eat local, seasonal food from the farmers’ market, and wake with the sun. Sounds idyllic, but you really wouldn’t want to be the only gay person in that village.  &#10;&#10;Later on, the parents would arrive. They would be sketching the ceiling, photographing the gardens, caressing swords and mousetraps and silks, stretching their legs, refreshing their brains. They may arrive believing that marriage begins with love, progresses to children and ends up with negotiations about property when the parties divorce. They might leave knowing marriage historically began with the property stuff, moved on to children, and ended with love. In short, they’d learn that nothing, neither good nor bad, has to stay the same way forever.  &#10;&#10;Although by evening my reign would be over, many of them would be back for more one day. A passion for history, you see, can grow slowly over the course of a lifetime, as time allows, so that a seed planted in childhood becomes a flowering tree in retirement.  &#10;&#10;And why is this tree a good tree? Well, one branch represents skills. Being a historian, if only for the day, teaches you useful things like judgment, and the ability to detect when someone is lying to you. Understanding the past also has the benefit of making you feel different: more open, more like a tiny grain of sand on an enormous beach of time. But the third branch is perhaps the most beautiful of all, because it is adorned with the foliage of fun. When they travel to the past, family members meet afresh, old friends are reunited, there’s something new to talk about.  &#10;&#10;Futile escapism, my detractors will sniff, what a waste of time to spend a day in never-never land. But just as travellers to distant lands bring back strange things, these visitors to the past will come home with valuable items that are not too plentiful in modern life: toleration, a sense of perspective, and a memory of a time that was fun and free from fear.  &#10;&#10;Lucy Worsley is a historian and presenter of Britain’s Tudor Treasure, on BBC2 at 9pm tonight  	Lucy Worsley: History can make people both more critical and more sceptical, and enables experiences that are missing from the modern world

Islam was revealed to save people from bloodshed and misuse of the sword. That is a paraphrasing of the cardinal's line in one of the Acts of Edward Bulwer-Lytton 1839 play "Richelieu".  &#10;&#10;The origin of the timeless adage is thought to have originated in Assyrian wisdom - like Islam, moral and value systems of Middle Eastern descent.  &#10;&#10;However, the moral, intellectual and ethical systems of that region - including those carried through dialogue with Hellenic ideas in the first three centuries of Islam - have all been subjected to obscurantist and literalist interpretations of revelation. Islam's first command to the Prophet Muhammad was to "read"; "Read in the name of thy Lord."  &#10;&#10;The first instruction was not to slay, fight or combat (all defensive measures to fend off aggressors against faith, homeland, intellect, dignity, progeny and property.)  &#10;&#10;Chapter 68 in the Quran is named "Al-Qalam" (the pen). It opens up with the verse: "By the pen and what they inscribe."  &#10;&#10;In Chapter 96 of the Quran one finds another reference to the high value placed on the might of the pen; "Who taught by the pen. Taught mankind that which he knew not" (96:4-5).  &#10;&#10;So it should be natural for Muslims today to feel total empathy towards fellow writers and journalists and the families of other victims in France. Especially in solidarity against the cowardly slaying of the Charlie Hebdo journalists and cartoonists.  &#10;&#10;Reading and writing belong to the "genus" of cross-disciplinary activities Islam insists upon repeatedly. Reading, writing and reasoning are all part and parcel of the way of life Islam is all about. In Chapter 55 we find "Allah - Most Gracious! It is He Who has taught the Quran. He has created man. He has taught him eloquence [intelligence]" (55:1-4).  &#10;&#10;The didactic ethos of numerous Quranic injunctions on the pen, knowing and reasoning, seem to be lost today in the heap of ignorance and obscurantism that is consuming many a Muslim land.  &#10;&#10;Lands where scholars of Islam underwrite political power at the expense of freedom of speech and a rational interpreting of the Quran that delivers Muslims from the yoke of oppression that is consuming Muslim youth and pleads the case of social justice, freedom of thought and tolerance.  &#10;&#10;The sad state of the violence that today engulfs Muslim cities, pitting Muslim against Muslim, is in no small measure the result of the over-politicisation and over-securitisation of Islam. Whole states are disintegrating, and religious and sectarian intolerance is ushering in a horrible era of annihilation and self-destruction.  &#10;&#10;Islam never began with jihad (a holy war). The miracle of the Prophet Muhammad is that he knew when to retreat (via Hijra or emigration) to build values of solidarity, peaceful coexistence with all kinds of "otherness" (such as in Medina and hostile Arab tribes), create know-how, and voluntarism in faith and membership of community, along with moderation ("wasatiyya").  &#10;&#10;Quran is the word for "reading".  &#10;&#10;Those Muslims who, in cold blood, killed French journalists and cartoonists, supposedly to "avenge the prophet" miss the point about the prophet's ways.  &#10;&#10;That includes the injunctions that "Verily, this Quran guides [human beings] to that which is most just" (17:9), and "If anyone took a life unless it be for murder and spreading injustice in the land, it would be as if he killed mankind entirely" (5:32).  &#10;&#10;Satire, criticism, and cartoons will never caricature the grand stature of the prophet nor diminish the sacredness of the Quran to Muslims and billions of tolerant human beings who share countries, ideologies or friendships with hundreds of millions of Muslims.  &#10;&#10;Denigration comes from the savagery of heinous violence and Manichean ways many self-professed learned scholars of Islam or self-serving politicians knowingly and unknowingly are pushing trusting Muslim youth and entire nations towards the abyss.  &#10;&#10;France has historically accommodated millions of Muslims who fled poverty, marginalisation and even oppression.  &#10;&#10;Many of those come from North Africa where Maghreb countries have benefited not only from remittances, but also from a vast shared space in which Muslims, Christians and Jews have learnt the art of toleration of differences.  &#10;&#10;What the murder of innocents in Paris has done is inflame inter-communal trust, and like the 9/11 attacks in the US 14 years ago, it has placed Muslims in the awkward position of being either unwelcome among host communities or defending Islam. This is because of the insane acts of co-religionists whose Islam is fixated on the "sword" and has little to do with the might of the "pen" that over millennia Muslim luminaries used to connect with others, and spread knowledge - not sow death.  	Lessons from the Quran are lost in the heap of ignorance and obscurantism that&#10;is consuming many a Muslim land.&#10;&#10;

In a film about Moses leading the Israelites out of ancient Egypt, the lead roles have gone to white actors - critics call this "whitewashing".  &#10;&#10;Scott's response, including telling his detractors to "get a life", has intensified the uproar. "I can't mount a film of this budget, where I have to rely on tax rebates in Spain [where the movie was shot], and say that my lead actor is Muhammad so-and-so from such-and-such," he said. "I'm just not going to get it financed."  &#10;&#10;Scott could have chosen his words more sensitively, but while critics have dismissed his reasoning, he does have a point. Scott works in Hollywood, which has never been sufficiently inclusive of ethnic minorities or, particularly in the case of Middle Easterners, fair in its portrayals of them. As such, he is stating more of an uncomfortable fact than an outlandish opinion.  &#10;&#10;A profit-driven industry  &#10;&#10;"Exodus", whose budget before the tax rebates is estimated at $200m, would probably not have received the necessary financing if the lead actors were Middle Eastern rather than Hollywood A-listers. Beyond that, its distribution and ticket sales would have been more limited.  &#10;&#10;Critics are overlooking the primary objective of any film industry, indeed any business: profit, without which they would not exist. Hollywood movies have much larger budgets than other film industries, so revenues play a much bigger role.  &#10;&#10;As such, there is nothing specific about "Exodus" that should single it out for criticism, besides being rather dull. The rationale behind who landed the lead roles is the same as that which led to a long list of other biblical movies being headlined by Hollywood heavyweights, rather than by actors from the region. Similarly, can you recall Hollywood epics about ancient Greece or the Roman empire where the lead actors were Greek or Italian?  &#10;&#10;This mindset is not unique to Hollywood. Take the Arab movie industry. Mustapha Akkad's classics "The Message" (about the Prophet Muhammad and the birth of Islam), and "The Lion of the Desert" (about Omar Mukhtar, who led the Libyan resistance against Italian occupation), were headlined not by Arab actors, but by Anthony Quinn. The main Italian character was played by Oliver Reed.  &#10;&#10;In "Black Gold", the principal Arab leaders were played by Antonio Banderas (in Spanish accent) and Mark Strong. Such a casting decision would have been influenced by "Black Gold" reportedly being one of the most expensive Arab- produced films about an Arab subject.  &#10;&#10;Hollywood is not necessarily less culturally sensitive than other film industries. If the latter could afford big names from the former, they would probably hire them. That is because audiences worldwide are more receptive to internationally recognisable stars (even if they are from minority groups) than relatively unknown local or regional actors.  &#10;&#10;The responsiblity of audiences  &#10;&#10;Film industries have to cater to audiences to maximise box-office sales. As such, we cannot criticise without reflecting on our own behaviour and tastes as consumers. If I had a penny for every time I heard an Arab complain about how we are portrayed in Hollywood, then pay money to watch a movie in which we are maligned, I could afford to make a big-budget film.  &#10;&#10;In this regard, Christian Bale, who plays Moses in "Exodus," responded aptly to condemnation of the film's casting: "We should all look at ourselves and say, 'Are we supporting wonderful actors in films by North African and Middle Eastern film-makers and actors?' Because there are some fantastic actors out there.  &#10;&#10;"If people start supporting those films more and more, then financiers in the market will follow. The audience has to show financiers that they will be there, and [then] they could make a large-budget film."  &#10;&#10;Scott has been criticised for relegating actors of racial origins more relevant to the film plot to peripheral or unsavoury characters. This is understandable, but given the economic considerations of casting A-listers in lead roles, he would have been lambasted had he not cast any ethnically appropriate actors.  &#10;&#10;Like Middle Eastern, Asian or African actors who play the stereotypical terrorist, it is their choice whether to accept such roles. Besides, if Arabs were given lead roles in "Exodus", they would have invariably played enslavers of Jews - as if we need more negative representation on the big screen.  &#10;&#10;A certain aspect of condemnation of the film is, in its own way, arguably racist, though unintentionally so. Some suggest that "people of colour" should have been cast as lead roles, as if Middle Easterners, Africans, Asians, Latin Americans and others are indistinguishable or interchangeable because they are various shades of brown.  &#10;&#10;For example, in the BBC series "House of Saddam", the Iraqi dictator's mother is played by Iranian Shohreh Aghdashloo with a thick Persian accent, despite the series being set during the Iran-Iraq war. Similarly, in Julian Schnabel's film "Miral", the Palestinian girl of the same name is played by Freida Pinto (with an Indian accent).  &#10;&#10;It would be naive to think that race plays no part in Hollywood casting, but one cannot ignore central financial considerations and consumer demand in the decision-making process. Nor, too, can we say that Hollywood is unique in this regard. Fingers are being pointed at "Exodus" and at Scott, but the net should be cast much more widely.  	Hollywood is a profit-driven industry which caters to its audience's&#10;preferences to maximise box-office sales.&#10;&#10;
216-rapeculturecampussilencemen	aljazeera	Thu, 04 Dec 2014 02:24:06 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/rape-culture-campus-silence-men-201412375326603164.html	Alice Driver	 Rape culture on campus: The silence of men	There are some voices that have been conspicuously absent since the publication of Sabrina Rubin Erdely's Rolling Stone article "A Rape on Campus: A Brutal Assault and a Struggle for Justice at UVA." Administrators at UVA were forced to respond to the allegations of a 2012 gang rape at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, and women came out in force to share their stories of sexual violence on campus.  &#10;&#10;Erdely received so much testimony from women on the UVA campus about the rape culture that she wrote a follow-up article "Rape at UVA: Readers Say Jackie Wasn't Alone." However, the fraternities on campus have been silent as a whole. And this is not only a UVA problem - rape culture, often cantered in the hypermasculine environment of fraternities, is an epidemic at colleges across the US. Gregory Orr, who has taught at UVA for the past 39 years, argued: "Fraternity culture is about as deeply implicated in misogyny and other prejudicial evils as you can imagine."  &#10;&#10;In September, New York Magazine ran a feature "Meet the College Women Who Are Starting a Revolution Against Campus Sexual Assault" that included the story of Emma Sulkowicz. She is a Columbia University student who, in response to being raped and seeing inaction on the part of her university to seek justice, strapped a mattress to her back and vowed to walk around campus until her rapist was expelled.  &#10;&#10;Women like Sulkowicz and Jackie (the victim at UVA) are insulted, mistreated, and ignored by the university administration until they take their stories public. In many of these stories of sexual violence, the victims are transformed into activists.  &#10;&#10;But where are the men, and in particular, where are the fraternity brothers? In the case of Jackie, seven fraternity brothers participated in the rape while two watched, and it took place at a fraternity party. We know that there were witnesses, and yet the fraternity and its members have been silent.  &#10;&#10;While some critics are calling for an end to Greek life, I ask that fraternity brothers speak out about sexual violence, which has been widely documented across the country, and act in solidarity with victims of violence.  &#10;&#10;I reached out to several fraternity brothers on the UVA campus for interviews, and I got only one response: "I'm sure you're aware of the moratorium the IFC placed on fraternities in regards to speaking to journalists about the Rolling Stone article."  &#10;&#10;The IFC should take this moment to promote open dialogue about sexual violence, and this requires admitting that the documented culture of sexual violence in fraternities has validity, and that fraternity brothers have been complicit in a culture that shames and silences rape victims.  &#10;&#10;Across the board denial of any mistreatment of women seems to be the modus operandi of fraternities. One fraternity brother at UVA agreed to speak to me as long as I didn't use his name or identify his fraternity. He said: "The only times I've ever seen or heard of disrespect towards women happening at our fraternity house was at the hand of non-brothers, and they were promptly thrown out."  &#10;&#10;To say the least, I find this hard to believe. Stories of disrespect towards women at fraternities or elsewhere on campus abound not only at UVA, but nationwide.  &#10;&#10;Fraternity culture is a vestige of the past, of a money and power pipeline that installs men into a network that protects and provides for them for life if they are loyal.  &#10;&#10;That power was on display when UVA made a choice about hiring an "independent" investigator to look into the gang rape allegations. Lawyer Mark Filip was selected to lead the independent investigation, this despite the fact that he was a member of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, the very same one whose members were accused of gang rape. He was later recused from the case.  &#10;&#10;Fraternity culture also represents antiquated values about gender, and on the UVA campus it manifests itself in a system in which fraternities have a monopoly on serving alcohol (drinking is not allowed at sororities). This installs fraternities at the very centre of college drinking and socialisation culture.  &#10;&#10;I wish I was writing the article, "Meet the College Fraternity Brothers Who Are Starting a Revolution Against Campus Sexual Assault," but that would mean that fraternities would have to quickly usher themselves into the 21st century. All it takes is a few inspired, outspoken individuals to start a movement against sexual violence, as victims of sexual violence have shown. It is time for fraternity brothers to join them, to use their strength and numbers to speak out against rape culture and work to change it.  	The recently revealed cases of sexual assaults at the University of Virginia&#10;should be a wake up call for fraternities.&#10;&#10;
217-readerseditormistakesamalcloon	guardian	2015-01-06T17:18:23Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/06/readers-editor-mistakes-amal-clooney-al-jazeera-egypt	Chris Elliott	The readers’ editor on… mistakes made in an article about Amal Clooney and the ‘al-Jazeera three’ jailed in Egypt	The arrest and conviction of three al-Jazeera journalists in Egypt has been the subject of a worldwide campaign to secure their release. The men were seized from a hotel and given long jail sentences on charges of abetting terrorists, spreading false news and endangering national security.  &#10;&#10;On Friday 2 January 2015 the Guardian published online an interview with Amal Clooney, who represents Mohamed Fahmy, one of the three jailed journalists. The other two are Baher Mohamed and Peter Greste.  &#10;&#10;The interview, which ranged over many aspects of the case, was given in the wake of the appeal hearing in Cairo on 1 January in which the three men were told they would have to face a retrial. During the course of it, Clooney revealed that a report which she co-authored had pinpointed flaws in the Egyptian judicial system that subsequently contributed to the three men’s conviction.  &#10;&#10;She told the Guardian that when the report, compiled on behalf of the International Bar Association, was due to be published “...first of all they stopped us from doing it in Cairo. They said: ‘Does the report criticise the army, the judiciary, or the government? We said: ‘Well, yes.’ They said: ‘Well then, you’re risking arrest.’”  &#10;&#10;A story headlined: “Egypt warns Amal Clooney she risks arrest over al-Jazeera three” was published at 3.19pm on 2 January on the Guardian’s website. The first sentence said: “Egyptian officials have warned human rights barrister Amal Clooney that she risks arrest after identifying serious flaws in its judicial system that contributed to the conviction of three al-Jazeera journalists now jailed in Cairo.”  &#10;&#10;However, due to an editing error in London, two key aspects of the story had been conflated, and both the headline and first sentence were wrong. Clooney had not been warned that she risked arrest “over the al-Jazeera three”. The warning about what might happen if the report was published in Egypt had been given in February 2014, long before she had any involvement in the case. This was a significant error.  &#10;&#10;Patrick Kingsley, the Guardian’s Cairo correspondent, who has reported on the case of the three journalists since they were arrested and who also conducted the interview, contacted the Guardian’s foreign desk within 35 minutes of the story going up on the website to warn of the errors and amend the copy. He had received complaints about the headline and the thrust of the story from Clooney.  &#10;&#10;Amendments were made and the headline now ran: “Egypt warns Amal Clooney she risked arrest”. But there was no footnote or correction published because of the short time lapse between publication and amendment. While our guidelines state that errors caught within the first hour or so, which have not excited comment, do not necessarily need to be footnoted, I think that on this occasion it was a mistake not to add one. It was a significant error, and one has to recognise that Clooney is a well-known figure.  &#10;&#10;The amended version was the one used in the print edition published on Saturday 3 January.  &#10;&#10;At 10.05 on Sunday 4 January the story was updated, with the addition of two paragraphs from the Egyptian police denying the allegation that Clooney faced arrest.  &#10;&#10;Editors were still concerned that the story lacked clarity, and further changes were made to the first few paragraphs to make the chronology clearer, ie that the warning of possible arrest related to what might happen if the report earmarking judicial flaws was published in Egypt.  &#10;&#10;These changes were made on the evening of Monday 5 January, and finally a footnote was added: “This article was amended on 4 January 2015 to include comments from the Egyptian police. It was further edited for clarity on 5 January 2015.”  &#10;&#10;At this stage there had still been no formal complaint to the readers’ editor’s office, but by 5pm editors made me aware of the problems. I wrote a longer, fuller footnote, and a correction was published online that evening and in print on Tuesday 6 January.  &#10;&#10;However, what I had not initially realised was that Clooney had co-authored an article for the Huffington Post website with Mark Wassouf, who also represents Fahmy, published on Sunday 4 January. In it, primarily, she set out the issues facing the three men including Fahmy, but also addressing her concerns about the Guardian story. In it she raised a fresh concern of which we were unaware. She described those who warned her of a possible arrest if any attempt was made to publish the report as “experts in Egyptian affairs”, whereas they were described in the text of the Guardian story as “Egyptian officials” and a subheading said she was “threatened by the authorities”.  &#10;&#10;The Huffington Post story said: “An article was published in the Guardian newspaper on 2 January 2015 stating that officials threatened Amal Clooney with arrest in Egypt in connection with her representation of Fahmy. The incident that was recounted in fact arose in early 2014 when the International Bar Association’s Human Rights Institute (IBA) – which was organizing the launch of a report co-authored by Mrs Clooney – was warned by experts in Egyptian affairs who were consulted on the launch that she and her colleague risked arrest if they launched the report in Cairo, in light of the criticisms made in the report and recent prosecutions for ‘crimes’ like insulting the judiciary, government or military in Egypt. As a result of these warnings, the IBA decided that it was not safe to hold the launch in Cairo, and the authors were forced to hold it in London instead. This incident arose before Mrs Clooney’s involvement in the Fahmy case, before the current president was in office and in a context entirely unrelated to this case … More importantly, the focus today should not be on the risks that lawyers or journalists faced in the past. The focus should be on the risks of free speech in today’s Egypt.”  &#10;&#10;When the Guardian asked Clooney on 5 January for more details of the individuals who gave the warning, she replied that the language she used had been reviewed by a colleague in the International Bar Association’s Human Rights Institute who was involved in writing the report and organising the launch, who agreed with the description that they were “experts in Egyptian affairs”.  &#10;&#10;I am not able to establish any more details about them. I think the Guardian believed that, in the context of the interview, the “they” to which Clooney refers were Egyptian officials who had given the warning. But we didn’t confirm that before publication, and in the light of that we have made a further set of changes to the headline, subheading and text.  &#10;&#10;In my view, it is a legitimate story and a matter of public interest that there was a warning of possible arrest in relation to publishing in Egypt a report about flaws flaws in the country’s judicial system that subsequently contributed to the conviction of the three men.  &#10;&#10;The report said Egypt’s judicial system was not as independent as it could be. It pointed out that officials in the ministry of justice have wide powers over nominally independent judges, and highlighted the control the government can exert over state prosecutors. There is a clear link.  &#10;&#10;However, the Guardian collectively made a number of errors by conflating two key aspects of the story, including a significantly misleading headline, and I apologise on behalf of the newspaper to Amal Clooney for those errors.  	Chris Elliott: Open door: The Guardian conflated two key aspects of the story, and initially published it under a significantly misleading headline; I apologise on behalf of the newspaper for those errors
218-realamericansniperhatefilledki	guardian	2015-01-06T18:00:10Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/06/real-american-sniper-hate-filled-killer-why-patriots-calling-hero-chris-kyle	Lindy West	The real American Sniper was a hate-filled killer. Why are simplistic patriots treating him as a hero?	I have to confess: I was suckered by the trailer for American Sniper. It’s a masterpiece of short-form tension – a confluence of sound and image so viscerally evocative it feels almost domineering. You cannot resist. You will be stressed out. You will feel. Or, as I believe I put it in a blog about the trailer, “Clint Eastwood’s American Sniper trailer will ruin your pants.”  &#10;&#10;But however effective it is as a piece of cinema, even a cursory look into the film’s backstory – and particularly the public reaction to its release – raises disturbing questions about which stories we choose to codify into truth, and whose, and why, and the messy social costs of transmogrifying real life into entertainment.  &#10;&#10;Chris Kyle, a US navy Seal from Texas, was deployed to Iraq in 2003 and claimed to have killed more than 255 people during his six-year military career. In his memoir, Kyle reportedly described killing as “fun”, something he “loved”; he was unwavering in his belief that everyone he shot was a “bad guy”. “I hate the damn savages,” he wrote. “I couldn’t give a flying fuck about the Iraqis.” He bragged about murdering looters during Hurricane Katrina, though that was never substantiated.  &#10;&#10;He was murdered in 2013 at a Texas gun range by a 25-year-old veteran reportedly suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.  &#10;&#10;However we diverge politically, I have enough faith in Eastwood’s artistry and intellect to trust that he is not a black-and-white ideologue – or, at least, that he knows that the limitations of such a worldview would make for an extremely dull movie. But the same can’t be said for Eastwood’s subject, or, as response to the film has demonstrated, many of his fans.  &#10;&#10;As Laura Miller wrote in Salon: “In Kyle’s version of the Iraq war, the parties consisted of Americans, who are good by virtue of being American, and fanatic Muslims whose ‘savage, despicable evil’ led them to want to kill Americans simply because they are Christians.”  &#10;&#10;Adds Scott Foundas at Variety: “Chris Kyle saw the world in clearly demarcated terms of good and evil, and American Sniper suggests that such dichromatism may have been key to both his success and survival; on the battlefield, doubt is akin to death.”  &#10;&#10;Eastwood, on the other hand, Foundas says, “sees only shades of gray”, and American Sniper is a morally ambiguous, emotionally complex film. But there are a lot of Chris Kyles in the world, and the chasm between Eastwood’s intent and his audience’s reception touches on the old Chappelle’s Show conundrum: a lot of white people laughed at Dave Chappelle’s rapier racial satire for the wrong reasons, in ways that may have actually exacerbated stereotypes about black people in the minds of intellectual underachievers. Is that Chappelle’s fault? Should he care?  &#10;&#10;Likewise, much of the US right wing appears to have seized upon American Sniper with similarly shallow comprehension – treating it with the same unconsidered, rah-rah reverence that they would the national anthem or the flag itself. Only a few weeks into its release, the film has been flattened into a symbol to serve the interests of an ideology that, arguably, runs counter to the ethos of the film itself. How much, if at all, should Eastwood concern himself with fans who misunderstand and misuse his work? If he, intentionally or not, makes a hero out of Kyle – who, bare minimum, was a racist who took pleasure in dehumanising and killing brown people – is he responsible for validating racism, murder, and dehumanisation? Is he a propagandist if people use his work as propaganda?  &#10;&#10;That question came to the fore last week on Twitter when several liberal journalists drew attention to Kyle’s less Oscar-worthy statements. “Chris Kyle boasted of looting the apartments of Iraqi families in Fallujah,” wrote author and former Daily Beast writer Max Blumenthal. “Kill every male you see,” Rania Khalek quoted, calling Kyle an “American psycho”.  &#10;&#10;Retaliation from the rightwing twittersphere was swift and violent, as Khalek documented in an exhaustive (and exhausting) post at Alternet. “Move your America hating ass to Iraq, let ISIS rape you then cut your cunt head off, fucking media whore muslim,” wrote a rather unassuming-looking mom named Donna. “Rania, maybe we to take you ass overthere and give it to ISIS … Dumb bitch,” offered a bearded man named Ronald, who enjoys either bass fishing or playing the bass (we may never know). “Waterboarding is far from torture,” explained an army pilot named Benjamin, all helpfulness. “I wouldn’t mind giving you two a demonstration.”  &#10;&#10;The patriots go on, and on and on. They cannot believe what they are reading. They are rushing to the defence of not just Kyle, but their country, what their country means. They call for the rape or death of anyone ungrateful enough to criticise American hero Chris Kyle. Because Chris Kyle is good, and brown people are bad, and America is in danger, and Chris Kyle saved us. The attitude echoes what Miller articulated about Kyle in her Salon piece: “his steadfast imperviousness to any nuance, subtlety or ambiguity, and his lack of imagination and curiosity, seem particularly notable”.  &#10;&#10;There is no room for the idea that Kyle might have been a good soldier but a bad guy; or a mediocre guy doing a difficult job badly; or a complex guy in a bad war who convinced himself he loved killing to cope with an impossible situation; or a straight-up serial killer exploiting an oppressive system that, yes, also employs lots of well-meaning, often impoverished, non-serial- killer people to do oppressive things over which they have no control. Or that Iraqis might be fully realised human beings with complex inner lives who find joy in food and sunshine and family, and anguish in the murders of their children. Or that you can support your country while thinking critically about its actions and its citizenry. Or that many truths can be true at once.  &#10;&#10;Always meet your heroes.  	Lindy West: Clint Eastwood’s film about Navy Seal Chris Kyle has hit a raw nerve in America, with right wingers calling for the rape or death of anyone ungrateful enough to criticise his actions
219-realstateourunionmoreentitleme	foxnews	2015-01-19T20:44:52Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/01/19/real-state-our-union-more-entitlements-taxes-and-unemployment/	Peter Morici	The Real State of Our Union: More entitlements, taxes and unemployment	  &#10;&#10;In his State of the Union address, President Obama will propose much he knows the Republican-controlled Congress will not enact, but his real agenda is to set the table for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.  &#10;&#10;Once again, the president will propose soaking the rich with higher estate, capital gains and bank taxes, while adding to entitlements for the working poor and middle class—new tax credits, higher child care allowance and more college tuition assistance.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;It all sounds appealing in an economy where the top 10 percent have done quite well, while the rest struggle—but it is not that simple.  &#10;&#10;The president will argue the economy—and especially the rich—can afford the taxes he wants because economic growth is so strong—but that’s a fib.  &#10;&#10;Since the recovery began, GDP growth has averaged a mere 2.3 percent a year—that’s about half what Ronald Reagan accomplished climbing out of a recession of comparable depth.  &#10;&#10;Now the recovery faces tough headwinds. Falling oil prices are curbing drilling in places like North Dakota and Texas, and big layoffs are not far behind.  &#10;&#10;The dollar is quite strong against other currencies, limiting exports and boosting job-killing imports, because China’s growth is faltering, Japan remains in neutral and Europe is on the edge of collapse under the weight of statism—the very kind Obama and Clinton want to impose on Americans.  &#10;&#10;The president proposes to legislate the basic contract between employers and workers. On top of higher minimum wages and mandated business financed health benefits, he wants employers to pay for mandatory sick leave and six weeks of paid parental leave.  &#10;&#10;After five years, Reagan increased employment by 9.4 percent, whereas Obama has boosted jobs only 4.5 percent. Consequently, nearly one in six prime working age men between 25 and 54 is not working, and 72 percent of those are not even bothering to look.  &#10;&#10;Obama has made Medicaid, food stamps and social security disability quite easy to get, and idle men form a new leisure class by combining those benefits with handouts from relatives and girlfriends.  &#10;&#10;For employers, a higher minimum wage, compulsory health insurance, and sick and parental leave will make those men even more costly to hire.  &#10;&#10;Enter stage left, more worker replacing robots.  &#10;&#10;The number of young people—and especially young men—starting small businesses has fallen dramatically—and that means fewer jobs over the next generation for everyone.  &#10;&#10;Young folks start enterprises by raising a lot of capital from older rich people.  &#10;&#10;Wealthy folks take the plunge on risky ventures, because the capital gains tax on successful enterprises is currently taxed at about 25 percent, whereas combined federal, state and local tax rates on ordinary income is often above 50 percent.  &#10;&#10;Young entrepreneurs, who generally have not amassed much wealth, can’t borrow nearly what they need from banks. Higher taxes on banks will make that problem worse.  &#10;&#10;Hiking capital gains taxes will directly discourage older successful investors, who also bring a wealth of practical management experience and advice for getting young ventures off the ground.  &#10;&#10;Older rich folks also take the plunge, because they can pass along assets at death to their children. But now the president wants to hike the tax rate on their estates, which is already 40 percent.  &#10;&#10;The president calls it fair because it only falls on one percent of the population, and will paint Republicans who resist as defending the rich to the detriment of struggling Americans.  &#10;&#10;His aim is to give Americans buyer’s remorse about electing a Republican Congress and boost a Clinton campaign for the White House emphasizing similar themes.  &#10;&#10;It would seem one out of six men unemployed, subsisting on government benefits and burdening relatives is not too high a price to elect another Democratic president.  	Once again, President Obama will propose soaking the rich with higher estate,&#10;capital gains and bank taxes, while adding to entitlements for the working&#10;poor and middle class—new tax credits, higher child care allowance and more&#10;college tuition assistance.&#10;&#10;
220-realthreatindianstate	aljazeera	Tue, 30 Dec 2014 01:04:51 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/real-threat-indian-state-2014123082252168711.html	SNM Abdi	The real threat to the Indian state	India projects itself as a target of Islamic terrorism perpetrated by home- grown Indian Mujahideen (IM) or Pakistan-based outfits particularly in India- administered Kashmir essentially to garner sympathy internationally and unite the population.  &#10;&#10;The truth, however, is that many armed groups like the Maoist uprising in the "Red Corridor" and the secessionist rebellion in the north-east pose a graver challenge to the Indian state than bombings and sporadic terrorist strikes which New Delhi touts to validate its vulnerability-cum-victimhood narrative before the world.  &#10;&#10;The latest Global Terrorism Index released by international think tank Institute of Economics and Peace reveals that while jihadists were responsible for 15 percent of terrorism-related killings in India; Maoists accounted for the lion's share of casualties - a whopping 50 percent - in 2013. The remaining 35 percent of deaths were caused by guerillas fighting for statehood or independence in states like Assam, Manipur and Nagaland.  &#10;&#10;Armed group, the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB), which gunned down 75 Adivasis, or tribespeople, just before Christmas in its diabolical pursuit of a separate homeland for ethnic Bodos in Assam, was on the government's radar for a long time.  &#10;&#10;The carnage provoked an uncompromising crackdown by the Indian army but thereby hangs a grim tale of political expediency.  &#10;&#10;Syed Asif Ibrahim, Intelligence Bureau director, seemed to have a premonition of the massacre. He pointed out that NDFB has become one of the deadliest separatist outfits in business at the IB's 49th annual conference in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Interior Minister Rajnath Singh in Assam's largest city, Guwahati, last month.  &#10;&#10;He observed that one option before the government was to bring NDFB to the negotiating table.  &#10;&#10;At present, though, negotiations are out of the question. "How can you hold talks with terrorists who thrust a gun into a five-month-old baby's mouth?" the interior minister said at a press conference even, as he dispatched army chief General Dalbir Singh Suhag to capture the killers and smash the group's network.  &#10;&#10;Singh could well have cited another instance of sheer savagery - a seven-year- old boy was shot seven times in his foot, thigh, abdomen, hand and face - to build a stronger case for the clampdown which surprised many.  &#10;&#10;Clearly, lightning action by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led federal government was in sharp contrast to the nationalist party's known stand on Bodo violence. The BJP didn't shed tears when NDFB shot dead 50 Bengali-speaking Muslims in May. But the party's own poll campaign then underway accused Bangladeshi Muslims of "destroying" India.  &#10;&#10;So the killings jelled with the BJP's political rhetoric; just days before the May butchery, Modi declared that Bangladeshis must keep their "bags packed" for deportation if he captured power.  &#10;&#10;Similarly, when NDFB slaughtered nearly a 100 Muslims and displaced half a million in July-August 2012, senior BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani immediately extended moral support to the Bodos. He publicly argued that the blood-bath was the result of a silent Bangladeshi demographic invasion straining resources and creating insecurity among Bodos.  &#10;&#10;The party also organised a seminar in New Delhi on "Bodo Hindus - Refugees in their own land: Bangladeshi Muslim infiltrators - the new kingmakers in an Indian state" with then BJP president, Nitin Gadkari, as a key speaker.  &#10;&#10;But decoding the BJP's somersault is pretty easy. NDFB killing Muslims and forcing terrified survivors into hellish refugee camps was par for the course as far as BJP was concerned. But training their guns on Adivasis was a blunder NDFB will regret for a long time.  &#10;&#10;The BJP immediately let loose the army on NDFB to repay a big debt of gratitude and regain Adivasi goodwill crucial for wresting Assam from the Congress Party in the 2016 state assembly elections.  &#10;&#10;Adivasis, who account for almost 20 percent of Assam's voters, ditched the Congress Party in this year's parliamentary elections and supported the BJP giving the party seven seats compared to four in 2009. The party's Adivasi candidates, Rameshwar Teli and Kamakhya Prasad Tasa, trounced Congress MPs in Dibrugarh and Jorhat.  &#10;&#10;The BJP's vote-share rose to 36.6 percent from 16.21 percent thanks to Adivasis - which also explains the BJP's muscular response to the December 23 massacre.  &#10;&#10;In a sense Bodos were tempting fate for a long time. They constitute barely six percent of Assam's 33 million population but want half of the state for themselves. They chose the path of terror way back in 1987 with the slogan "Divide Assam 50-50" leaving behind a trail of murder and mayhem.  &#10;&#10;The first tripartite peace treaty between the federal government, state government and Bodos was signed in 1993 but it collapsed under the weight of its own contradictions. Another accord signed in 2003 resulted in the Bodo Territorial Autonomous District (BTAD) giving them considerable autonomy.  &#10;&#10;BTAD covering around 8,795 square-km area was given to Bodos on a platter although they comprised only 20 percent of the population in BTAD.  &#10;&#10;The rest are predominantly Muslims - many of whom are migrants from Bangladesh - and Adivasis.  &#10;&#10;Bodos floated a political party called Bodoland People's Front (BPF) to administer BTAD, but armed groups, such as Bodo Liberation Tigers (BLT) and NDFB with their extremist-supremacist agenda, called the shots.  &#10;&#10;It was a bizarre case of 20 percent ruling over 80 percent!  &#10;&#10;Because Bodos didn't enjoy numerical majority, they resorted to ethnic cleansing. And whether their targets were Muslims or Adivasis, Bodos invariably inflicted more casualties than they suffered primarily because they didn't surrender their arms as they were supposed to after the 2003 accord.  &#10;&#10;Now the army's brief is to defang NDFB by snatching their guns before eliminating them.  &#10;&#10;The political motive behind the crackdown is crystal clear. Even otherwise, Singh, the interior minister, is increasingly realising the consequences of armed groups having a free run. Earlier this month he flew to Raipur, capital of Chattisgarh state, after Maoists killed 14 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) soldiers in cold blood.  &#10;&#10;Singh wanted to visit the ambush site about 450km from Raipur. But security forces warned him that Maoists were capable of bringing down his helicopter! So Singh couldn't make his way to the blood-soaked Ground Zero literally in the centre of India - a sad commentary on a nuclear nation’s internal security scenario.  	The recent massacre of Adivasis in Assam demonstrates the danger secessionist&#10;militant groups pose to the Indian state.&#10;&#10;

Remember: you are not alone	In the light of the sad case of Leelah Alcorn, the Ohio transgender teenager who killed herself after being forced to undergo conversion therapy, I have been asked how teenagers can deal with parents who are completely unsupportive or hostile to their emerging independent identity.  &#10;&#10;You don’t choose your parents. You are at their mercy. They control your environment – to a great extent, they are your environment. You don’t have the power to control your own resources: your own money, or even your own food. When you were a baby you had even less autonomy, and for you to develop you had to do so in relationship with them. How you think, feel, move and speak is created with your parents. Even more importantly, how you learn to soothe yourself in the face of pain or upset is in large part down to how they soothed you when you were growing up.  &#10;&#10;As you develop, more influences affect who and what you are and allow different parts of you to grow. You go to school, meet more people and hear more ideas, and you begin to experience urges and feelings in yourself that may not be recognised by your parents, or even anyone else you know. But these days, we have the internet, so there is usually someone out there who can understand to some extent how you feel. All of us have a need to have our internal selves mirrored by the people around us. It’s unlikely that anyone finds themselves always completely understood by relying on how others respond to them, but we all have a need to seek this type of connection – especially if we don’t find anything approaching it at home.  &#10;&#10;Not being understood by our parents is one thing, but what if a teenager feels persecuted for not being exactly like their family or peers? What if he or she is persecuted, abused, put through exorcisms or so-called conversion therapies? Some people who survived time in concentration camps told of the importance of holding on to their imagination and their minds. But when you are being abused by your parents that is harder to do because we have a need to believe that our parents good. Otherwise, we rationalise, how can we be safe?  &#10;&#10;So the unconscious process that tends to happen is that we start to blame ourselves for how we feel instead. Often young people don’t think of waiting it out until they can flee, because time seems to pass more slowly as a teenager,so there can be a real danger of teenage suicide.  &#10;&#10;Despite the terrible feelings of rejection a teenager might experience, one day they may be able to understand their parents’ point of view. If they are strict and inflexible – unable to move with the times or accept anything other than their values – this is probably the result of trauma: either their own trauma or transgenerational trauma – trauma passed on to them by their parents.  &#10;&#10;When we are not traumatised, we can live fluidly in the present, responding to situations as they arise. But when traumatised, people stick to strict rules and codes, as though living in emergency mode, and they are fearful of deviating from these. So when they see their children being very different from them, they panic. In their belief system, to deviate from the rule book is to be cast out. And to be cast out is to be unsafe, and possibly to die. They are worried because they cannot imagine accepting you as you want to be, cannot imagine that it would be possible for you to be accepted anywhere. They may even fear that because you are different, they will no longer be accepted by their community.  &#10;&#10;The main emotion holding this system together is shame and the fear of feeling shame. Shame feels like an annihilation. If the teenager can sense some of this, it may help them to take the persecution they get from their parents less personally. Because it is unhelpful to see one party as good and the other as bad. Everyone needs to be listened to.  &#10;&#10;What advice would I give to the teenager who is rejected or tormented by their parents for their beliefs, identity or sexuality? Find a sympathetic witness for what you are going through: a friend, a teacher, a school counsellor – someone whose idea of you actually reflects who you feel you really are. You can then hold on to their image of you when times are tough. And most importantly, although it feels like a lifetime, it isn’t. You will be able to walk away one day and build a new network consisting of mutual support around you.  	Philippa Perry: My advice to any teenager tormented for their beliefs, identity or sexuality is, find a sympathetic witness to your ordeal
222-religiousfreedomday2015whatour	foxnews	2015-01-16T15:41:07Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/01/16/religious-freedom-day-2015-what-our-founders-understood-about-freedom-faith/	Sen. James Lankford	 Religious Freedom Day 2015: What our Founders understood about freedom of faith	(AP)  &#10;&#10;Friday, January 16 is Religious Freedom Day, a celebration of one of the powerful and unique freedoms within our nation’s founding and fabric.  &#10;&#10;In 1992, the House and Senate joined together to pass a resolution designating January 16th as Religious Freedom Day. This day is based on the anniversary of the 1786 passage of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, originally authored by Thomas Jefferson. Congress formally recognized that the “Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom inspired and shaped the guarantees of religious freedom in the First Amendment.”  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;President George H. W. Bush issued the first proclamation in 1992, noting that “American law and institutions have been shaped by a view of man that recognizes the inherent rights and dignity of individuals.”  &#10;&#10;For the last 24 years, each president has made an annual declaration and encouraged Americans to "observe this day through appropriate events and activities in homes, schools, and places of worship."  &#10;&#10;To better understand the Founder’s intent for this precious right, we must return to the actual text of the 1786 statute. Most notably, it reads: “…no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced …in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinion in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.”  &#10;&#10;The Founders understood that there is a direct connection between the prosperity and health of a nation and its respect for human rights and religious freedom. Individual faith grows when people live free of government coercion and control.  &#10;&#10;In America, any person can live their faith or choose to have no faith; in many parts of the world that simple truth is revolutionary. This fundamental right at the core of our nation allows the United States to champion religious freedom around the world.  &#10;&#10;Our own State Department’s Office of International Religious Freedom appropriately reinforces this value by saying, “Given the U.S. commitment to religious freedom, and to the international covenants that guarantee it as the inalienable right of every human being, the United States seeks to: Promote freedom of religion and conscience throughout the world as a fundamental human right and as a source of stability for all countries.”  &#10;&#10;Over the last few years, there have been many heated conversations in our own country about the role of religious freedom in our society, like pubic prayer, abortion, college campus organization, religious symbols, and many others.  &#10;&#10;Last summer’s Supreme Court decision affirming the right to live and work in accordance with one’s convictions was contentious, but the High Court reinforced the right of Americans to not just have a faith, but to actually enter the marketplace and practice that faith as well. Religion that is contained only within a church building is a weekend hobby, not a personal faith.  &#10;&#10;Our nation’s Founders fled from a regime of religious persecution, sacrificing their lives to birth a new place of liberty. They not only believed that religious freedom was fundamental to shape this new nation, but that religious freedom was a fundamental human right for all. As we celebrate and recognize religious freedom today, let us reflect and remember that it has served as an important pillar of this nation from the start. For America to maintain its greatness, Washington must honor and prioritize religious freedom in public policy, as well as in culture.  &#10;&#10;Our nation has not grown past freedom of faith, in many ways we have grown because of our freedom of faith.  	Friday, January 16 is Religious Freedom Day, a celebration of one of the&#10;powerful and unique freedoms within our nation’s founding and fabric.&#10;&#10;

There are many unanswered questions about the TTP. How big is the group? Have its ties to the Pakistani intelligence agencies become stronger since Mullah Fazlullah, of Swat fame, became its leader, given his own past affiliation with Pakistan's powerful spy agency ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence)? Or is the group closer now to other foreign funders?  &#10;&#10;The absence of convincing answers to such questions has resulted in ongoing debates on the appropriate response to this horror. From US-backed media personalities supporting the establishment of concentration camps for entire populations in some parts of the tribal areas, to the broadening of ongoing military operations, the overwhelming thrust among many vocal commentators has been for countering this violence with more violence.  &#10;&#10;However, there is also a deep scepticism about a primarily military response within the Pakistani society, which is why successive governments have been secretive about such operations. Despite repeated calls for stronger military action by the US government and also many influential commentators within Pakistan, there is widespread suspicion that these army operations end up killing more civilians than militants.  &#10;&#10;It is easy, but completely misleading, to write off this widespread scepticism about military responses to the Taliban violence as driven by sympathetic sentiments or worse, as the inability of Pakistanis to face the hard facts of home-grown terror. We must recognise that it is a mistrust borne of experience with the military's role in Pakistani politics.  &#10;&#10;More critically, we need to recognise the long-term impact of the Pakistani state's support for the "war on terror" and its operations in the tribal areas over the last decade. There is a growing sense of deprivation and discrimination among Pashtuns across the country, and further state violence in the region has to be carefully weighed against the very real possibility of serious backlash.  &#10;&#10;While we all agree that there must be a response to these atrocities, for it to be effective, both at the state and societal level, it is imperative that it is calibrated to the level of threat posed by wide range of groups contained within the category "Taliban".  &#10;&#10;All four are a direct result of the chaos created by the US' war in the region and the supply of drugs, arms and men that such a war invariably engenders. But these four groups all require different responses. The local defence militias can be ignored for now. The mercenaries and criminals need to be treated precisely as that: controlling and managing their sources of incomes or in some cases, completely eroding them.  &#10;&#10;However, the first two groups require a much broader and more complex response. There is, unfortunately, no short-cut to political transparency that is required for their dismantling.  &#10;&#10;Aggressive and persistent public questioning and scrutiny of Pakistani generals and politicians associated with the state funded militia, as well as their support for the "war on terror" in the region, is the only viable strategy available to citizens of Pakistan for a lasting resolution. In this context, the religious vs secular binary is completely artificial. The most secular generals of the Pakistani army have been happy to support some versions of Taliban as well as to benefit financially and politically by supporting the US war in the region.  &#10;&#10;A key step in this direction has to be the demand for greater information about the militants who attacked the school in Peshawar. Although TTP has claimed responsibility for the tragedy, it is important to establish who precisely is involved. How did they get past the three check points in the defence colony where the school is located? Which cities/villages did the militants who were killed come from? How does that correspond to the profiles of the attackers in the past? Where is that information about past attackers anyway? What are their organisational careers and educational backgrounds? Where are their families, and what can they tell us about the path their sons took?  &#10;&#10;Calling on the very same generals to carry out military operations against the operatives they have supported and created is surely a strategy fraught with contradictions, though favoured by some vocal analysts and by the US government. The collective punishment of the people of the tribal areas as a "solution" may appeal to some because of its deceptive simplicity, but it is an extremely dangerous strategy likely to further shred the fabric of Pakistani public life.  	A military response to the Peshawar massacre will produce only more violence&#10;in Pakistan.&#10;&#10;
224-revisitingbritishconquestje	aljazeera	Sun, 14 Dec 2014 03:18:17 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/revisiting-british-conquest-je-2014121381243881138.html	Hatem Bazian	Revisiting the British conquest of Jerusalem	On December 11, 1917, a mere two days after the above letter was written, British General Edmund Allenby entered Jerusalem triumphantly through the Jaffa gate, and the city became an occupied territory. On this historic occasion, Allenby reportedly declared that "the wars of the crusades are now complete". Allenby's statement is a powerful reminder that the British entry into Jerusalem was a continuation of and a "successful" conclusion to the Crusades. Certainly, Allenby's statement introduces a critical epistemic connection between the modern British colonial project in Palestine and the Crusades of the 11-14th century.  &#10;&#10;The then Prime Minister David Lloyd George described the capture of Jerusalem as "a Christmas present for the British people"; he had advised Allenby to take the city before the Holidays.  &#10;&#10;Allenby's statement on the Crusades was not an isolated one, as illustrated by a number of British press and book publications from the period. For example, Punch ran a headline on December 19, 1917 declaring "the Last Crusade" with an illustration of "Richard Coeur de Lion looking down towards Jerusalem and nodding contentedly, 'My dream comes true!'"  &#10;&#10;The British press was initially instructed in a "private and confidential" memo dated November 15, 1917, not to refer to the "military operations against Turkey in any sense as a Holy War, a modern Crusade, or anything whatever to do with religious questions". However, the press after a brief period ignored the instructions and started using the word "Crusade" in discussing the occupation of Jerusalem.  &#10;&#10;The memo was intended to prevent any friction with Muslim troops recruited from British colonies to fight in the war and avoid harming the alliance with Sharif Hussein of Mecca.  &#10;&#10;More importantly, the British Department of Information itself began to use the word "Crusade" to convey a very distinctive religious and historical connection to earlier periods. The department celebrated in a telegram from Palestine that "two of the commanders who have played a great part in the South Palestine campaign are descended from knights who fought in the wars of the Crusades".  &#10;&#10;A few months after the conquest of Jerusalem, the Department of Information produced a 40-minute documentary entitled "The New Crusades: With the British Forces on the Palestine Front", thus articulating the new colonial adventure in distinctive religious terms.  &#10;&#10;Furthermore, a large number of books from the period had "Crusade" incorporated into their titles: "Khaki Crusaders" (1919), "Temporary Crusaders" (1919), "The Modern Crusaders" (1920), "The Last Crusade" (1920), "With Allenby's Crusaders" (1923), and "The Romance of the Last Crusade" (1923).  &#10;&#10;There was a clear urge to frame the colonisation project in Palestine in religious terms and view it as a continuation of the earlier Muslim-Christian conflict, despite claims of fighting the Ottomans on the basis of European secularism and anti-religious modernity.  &#10;&#10;The British were not the only ones thinking in these terms. In his book The Clash of Fundamentalisms: Crusades, Jihads and Modernity, Tariq Ali describes how the French commander Henri Gouraud upon entering Damascus with his troops, went to Saladin's tomb, kicked it and proclaimed; "The Crusades have ended now! Awake Saladin, we have returned! My presence here consecrates the victory of the Cross over the Crescent".  &#10;&#10;The idea of the "Crusade" was incorporated into the support extended to the Zionist movement and the plan to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Indeed, theological interpretations and attempts at recreating the biblical past were aimed at ushering in a distorted extreme right-wing Christian vision of the world that involved Israel as a stepping stone for its realisation in anticipation of the Second Coming.  &#10;&#10;Colonisation project  &#10;&#10;The British Occupation in 1917 made it possible to put into action the Balfour Declaration and the plan for building a Jewish homeland at the expense of the Palestinians. The British undertook this project not out of love or concern for Jews - on the contrary some of the strongest supporters of Zionism were ardent anti-Semites, including Lord Balfour himself. Europe's theoretically constructed racist, bigoted and intolerant attitudes and policies towards Jews were the primary reason for supporting Zionism.  &#10;&#10;December 11, 1917 is the day that Jerusalem was lost. On this date, Palestine entered the colonial tunnel and the dispossession of its indigenous population began. From this date forward, Palestine, Jerusalem and the Palestinians were set on a course of confrontation with the British and the Zionists who worked together to create a national home for the Jewish people.  &#10;&#10;While the 1948 Nakba led to the physical expulsion of some 750,000 Palestinians, it is the British occupation in 1917 followed by the Mandate that sealed Palestine's fate as the last colonial project to be commissioned. Thus, Zionism was incubated in the British colonial womb with an umbilical cord connected to Europe's settler, colonial and racist epistemology.  &#10;&#10;The British occupation made it possible for Zionism to get a foothold in Palestine. What followed was the tormenting of the Palestinians through ethnic cleansing and expulsion, massacres, home demolitions, settlement expansions, land confiscation, everyday violence, attacks on al-Aqsa, building an Apartheid Wall and issuing more than 40 laws descriminating Palestinians. The last chapter of this story will be written by the Palestinians and their allies around the world and for sure it will praise freedom, dignity and the end of racist colonialism in Palestine.  	The day the British entered Jerusalem in 1917, Palestine's fate was sealed.&#10;&#10;
225-risepolandurbanmovement	aljazeera	Tue, 09 Dec 2014 12:55:26 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/rise-poland-urban-movement-2014129899563822.html	Igor Stokfiszewski 	The rise of Poland's urban movement	Poland's recent local elections went according to the usual script: The ruling coalition of the Civic Platform and Polish People's Party retained their control over major cities. But there was one political surprise in the final results. The urban movement, which ran for the first time in elections as a nationwide coalition of city activists, won the mayor's seat in Gorzow Wielkopolski, in western Poland, and a number of city council seats in big cities like Warsaw, Poznan and Torun.  &#10;&#10;Although a newcomer to the electoral race, the urban movement dictated the direction of most election campaigns. Their demands ended up in the electoral programmes of mainstream political parties, which scrambled to attract grassroot activists on their lists to capture the youth leftist vote.  &#10;&#10;So what is this new political force and can it permanently transform Polish local and state politics?  &#10;&#10;In late 2007, a group of residents of the Rataje district in Poznan, in western Poland, organised to defend their right to have a say in the planning of their neighbourhood. The mayor of Poznan and the city council, had proposed to transform the derelict post-industrial zone of the neighbourhood into a new residential and commercial area. Local residents, on the other hand, insisted on building a park and a recreational area. They mobilised the community, organised protests, wrote petitions and publicised the issue in the media.  &#10;&#10;The negative publicity made the situation uncomfortable enough for local officials to concede to public pressure and withdraw their commercial development proposal. This was the first sign that a new social force was emerging with the potential to affect urban policies in Poland through civic engagement.  &#10;&#10;Grassroot activities began to surface in other Polish cities around that time. Activists from Sopot in northern Poland started calling for participatory budgeting following the model of the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre.  &#10;&#10;In Lodz, in central Poland, an informal group of active citizens organised themselves around the issue of cleanliness of public spaces. Gradually, these groups merged into a movement calling for citizen participation in the transformation of the post-industrial area of the city, just like in Poznan. Lodz used to be an important industrial centre up until 1989 when its textile industry collapsed and many industrial buildings lay abandoned and derelict.  &#10;&#10;In Warsaw, urban activists organised demonstrations for the preservation of green areas in the centre of the Polish capital; against hikes in public transport fees,;and against privatisation of municipal buildings.  &#10;&#10;In the last few years, groups like Right to the City, Inhabitants' Forum, and the Housing Movement have emerged in almost every Polish town bringing together individuals of various ages, social, and cultural backgrounds. These groups were involved in a variety of campaigns to reassert residents' rights to their neighbourhoods and towns: from writing petitions, to organising protests, pickets and demonstrations, to occupying vacant buildings, setting up squats and blocking evictions.  &#10;&#10;Their political appetite grew with time. In 2010, Poznan activists formed: "We, the Inhabitants of Poznan," social electoral committee to contest local elections. They received almost 10 percent of the votes, but with an electoral law favouring big political parties, they failed to get a seat on the council.  &#10;&#10;This electoral experience facilitated the launching, in 2011, of an informal coalition - the Urban Movements Congress - comprising urban activist groups from all over Poland.  &#10;&#10;The congress was tasked with formulating a programme to provide a common foundation around which urban activists would build their campaigns in local communities.  &#10;&#10;The programme was focused on three main pillars: policies to stem and reverse the growth of socioeconomic inequalities and exclusion; sustainable environment-conscious urban development in the interest of all residents; and promotion of direct democracy practices such as social consultations, participatory budgeting and referendums.  &#10;&#10;After the founding of the congress, the urban movements grew in strength and impact.  &#10;&#10;On the national level, the congress managed to pressure the Ministry of Regional Development to include some of its policies in its 2012 National Urban Policy (NUP) programme.  &#10;&#10;On the local level, urban activists managed to reap a number of victories.  &#10;&#10;In 2011, after much "harassment" from activists, the mayor of Sopot agreed to implement participatory budgeting in the city. Residents now can decide on how to spend 5 million zlotys (about $1.6m) or one percent of the municipal budget.  &#10;&#10;Other mayors soon followed suit. In Lodz, residents decide on how to spend 40 million zlotys ($13m). The mayor of Lodz also invited local activists to advise the city council's Revitalisation Bureau on specific policies for the socioeconomic development of the city.  &#10;&#10;The reason why Lodz became more accepting of the urban movement's demands was because its previous mayor was removed in a popular referendum in January 2010. The mayors of Czestochowa, Olsztyn, Elblag, Bytom and Ostroda were also removed in the same manner for introducing policies regarding privatisation and commercial development which went against the will of their electorates.  &#10;&#10;The same fate threatened the mayor of Warsaw, but the low turnout at the referendum saved her. After surviving in her post, she quickly implemented some of the urban movement's demands.  &#10;&#10;But the most spectacular achievement of the Polish urban movement in recent months was putting Krakow's candidacy to host the 2022 Winter Olympic Games to a referendum.  &#10;&#10;After it was announced in November 2013 that local authorities had decided to put forward Krakow's candidacy for the Olympics, activists launched a campaign called Krakow Against Games, which aimed to inform people of the negative consequences of hosting big sporting event.  &#10;&#10;City authorities caved in under popular pressure and put the decision to a referendum, with the condition that it has at least a 30 percent turnout. Knowing that the 2010 EU elections had only a 26 percent turnout, they combined the referendum with the 2014 EU elections.  &#10;&#10;To the displeasure of local authorities, some 36 percent of Krakow's citizens voted and 70 percent of those said no to the games.  &#10;&#10;Victory of the Krakow Against Games campaign showed that referendums can be an important tool in bringing local policies in line with residents' will and that urban activists have considerable social support.  &#10;&#10;The Krakow victory gave impetus to the formation by of nationwide coalition of 12 sociopolitical entities affiliated with the Urban Movements Congress to contest the 2014 local elections. The results of the election demonstrated that the movement can translate its grassroot support into electoral victories.  &#10;&#10;With the 2015 parliamentary and presidential elections approaching, the coalition is hopeful that it will have an even larger political impact in the coming year.  &#10;&#10;The urban movement has a long way to go in order to occupy a permanent place on Poland's political map, but its public presence, successful campaigns and increasing social support show that there is a definite shift in Polish people's sociopolitical attitudes. There is clearly growing support for sustainable and environment-conscious development which aims to level out inequalities and exclusion and usher in effective practices of direct democracy.  	Recent successes of Polish urban movement suggest that people are ready for a&#10;different way of practising democracy.&#10;&#10;

Russia needed a year-round ice-free port for its naval fleet and Imperial Japan saw this encroachment as a threat. After early setbacks in the war, Russia needed to quickly reinforce its naval fleet in the Pacific Ocean with its Baltic Fleet.  &#10;&#10;With its Baltic Fleet literally on the other side of the world, Russia's options were limited. Ice blocked the route along Russia's northern coastline - known today as the Northern Sea Route. The British blocked access to the Suez Canal. It finally took the Baltic Fleet seven months to get to the Sea of Japan via the Cape of Good Hope. The fleet arrived knackered and ill-prepared for battle.  &#10;&#10;On May 28, 1905, nearly the entire Russian fleet was destroyed during the Battle of Tsushima - Russia had no choice but to sue for peace.  &#10;&#10;If Arctic ice continues to decrease at its current rate it is possible Russia will not have this problem in the future. Each year more ships are making the journey through the Northern Sea Route. In some cases this reduces the distance between European and north Asian ports by 30 percent.  &#10;&#10;While the economic advantages are obvious, the use of the Northern Sea Route offers military advantages as well.  &#10;&#10;Russia's interests in the Arctic go beyond the economic and military advantages offered by the Northern Sea Route. The region is rich in minerals, wildlife, fish, and other natural resources. Some estimates claim that 13 percent of the world's undiscovered oil reserves and almost one-third of the world's undiscovered natural gas reserves are located in the Arctic region.  &#10;&#10;The majority of these untapped resources are also in areas to which Russia lays claim.  &#10;&#10;For now, the Arctic region is an area of low conflict, and it is in everyone's interest to keep it that way. Although the security challenges currently faced in the Arctic are not military in nature, there is still a requirement for military capability in the region that can support civilian authorities.  &#10;&#10;For example, civilian search and rescue and natural disaster response - in such an unforgiving environment as the Arctic - can be augmented by the military.  &#10;&#10;So it should be no surprise that like Russia, other Arctic countries deploy military assets into the region. Even so, Russia has taken steps to increase military capability in the region that seems to be beyond the scope of supporting civilian operations.  &#10;&#10;One must consider the implications of Russia's increased military presence in the region in light of Moscow's recent aggression against Ukraine.  &#10;&#10;This month, Russia activated its new Arctic command to better coordinate all Russian military activities in the Arctic. The ultimate goal for Russia to deploy a combined arms force in the Arctic by 2020, appears to be on track. Russia's primary military focus in the Arctic is in the maritime sphere.  &#10;&#10;A cause for concern  &#10;&#10;New Russian naval doctrine calls for Russia to increase its maritime presence in the Arctic. Already, Russia's Northern Fleet, which is based in the Arctic, counts for two-thirds of the Russian navy.  &#10;&#10;There will be a significant increase of Russian ground troops based in the region too. Over the next few years two new so-called Arctic brigades will be permanently based above the Arctic Circle, and the current regiment of marines assigned to the Northern Fleet will increase by one-third.  &#10;&#10;Russia has plans to build 13 airfields as well as 10 radar posts along the course of the Northern Sea Route. Most of these airfields will be refurbished Soviet era bases, but others will be new.  &#10;&#10;For Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Arctic is an area that allows Russia to flex its muscles without incurring any significant geopolitical risk.  &#10;&#10;Because nationalism is on the rise in Russia, Putin's Arctic strategy is popular among the population.  &#10;&#10;Russian activity in the Arctic, whether military, economic or scientific, harks back to images of Peter the Great and the Great Northern Expedition in the 18th century. This helps Putin with his dream of bringing Russia back to its former imperial glory.  &#10;&#10;It is Russia's prerogative to place military assets inside its national territory, however, these actions should be of concern to others in the region because Moscow has shown its willingness to use military force to achieve its national objectives outside its national borders.  &#10;&#10;One must assume the Arctic region would be no different.  	Russia is already militarily securing the new economic opportunities that&#10;melting ice in the Arctic is uncovering.&#10;&#10;
227-russiacaucasusgeorgiaarmeni	aljazeera	Sat, 17 Jan 2015 07:15:03 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/01/russia-caucasus-georgia-armeni-2015114111654383153.html	Luke Coffey	Russia's next acquisition	It is no secret that Russia views the South Caucasus as being in its natural sphere of influence. In light of Russia's annexation of Crimea, and on the back of Moscow's recent treaties with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Georgians have legitimate reasons to believe that Russian activity in their country will only increase in 2015.  &#10;&#10;Consequently, many are keeping a close eye on the Georgian province of Samtskhe-Javakheti - a majority ethnically Armenian region located just three hours' drive from the nation's capital city of Tbilisi.  &#10;&#10;Causing instability in Samtskhe-Javakheti would achieve two goals for Moscow.  &#10;&#10;First, it would further dismember the territorial integrity of Georgia. The Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia are already under Russian occupation. By some accounts they are closer than ever to being annexed by Moscow. An independent Samtskhe-Javakheti, or one under Russian influence, would divide Georgia down the middle.  &#10;&#10;Armenian separatism in Samtskhe-Javakheti might not be as vocal as it was only a few years ago; but there is still a fear that Moscow could easily reenergise separatist movements in the region.  &#10;&#10;Secondly, and more importantly for Russia, bringing the region under Moscow's influence would make a land corridor between Russia and Armenia, via South Ossetia, one step closer. This is important because Russia maintains a sizeable military presence in Armenia. The bulk of the Russian force is based in the city of Gyumri and consists of approximately 5,000 soldiers and dozens of fighter planes and attack helicopters.  &#10;&#10;Russia has long had the difficult challenge of supplying these forces, especially since Georgia and Turkey refuse transit rights. This has left a reliance on Iran, which for obvious reasons, is not ideal for Russia.  &#10;&#10;It is not only for Russia that Samtskhe-Javakheti is strategically important, but also for Europe.  &#10;&#10;The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline and the South Caucasus Pipeline, carrying oil and gas respectively from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, passes through the province.  &#10;&#10;As the possibility of more Central Asian oil and gas finding its way to Europe becomes likely, these pipelines bypassing Russia will become a vital part of Europe's energy security.  &#10;&#10;In addition, the Kars-Tbilisi-Baku railway, which is due to open later this year, passes through Samtskhe-Javakheti. It is expected that this rail line will eventually transport 3 million passengers and over 15 million tons of freight each year.  &#10;&#10;There is a perfect storm brewing in the region and if Russia wanted to exploit the situation in Samtskhe-Javakheti it could not ask for better timing than now.  &#10;&#10;First is the fact that many Javakheti Armenians have Russian sympathies. Until its closure in 2007, the Russian military base there was the single biggest source of employment. It has also been reportedthat Moscow is issuing Russian passports to ethnic Armenians living in the region.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;This in itself is telling; Russia issued passports to Abkhazians and South Ossetians just before its 2008 invasion of Georgia and also issued passports to Crimeans ahead of the annexation of Crimea last year.  &#10;&#10;But Russia is only part of the problem. Many of the grievances Javakheti Armenians have are a result of poor policy making by the central government in Tbilisi.  &#10;&#10;Many Javakheti Armenians feel that their culture and language are discriminated against. There has been a decrease in the quality of education among the Javakheti Armenian population.  &#10;&#10;The bilingual education program of teaching in both Georgian and Armenian has been described as a "total failure" because there are not enough qualified teachers with proficiency in both languages.  &#10;&#10;Unemployment is high in Samtskhe-Javakheti and future economic prospects in the region look bleak. Many Javakheti Armenians travel to Russia or Armenia for work.  &#10;&#10;Economy strained  &#10;&#10;Thanks to the drop in the value of the Russian ruble - almost one-third of its value in the past year - remittances have also decreased. The unusually harsh winter in the region is placing a further strain on economic activity.  &#10;&#10;Then there is the issue of citizenship and immigration. Many Javakheti Armenians do not have Georgian citizenship. Instead, many hold Armenian passports because finding seasonal work in Armenia and Russia is easier this way.  &#10;&#10;Until recently, Armenian citizens were allowed to live and work inside Georgia without any special authorisation as long as they crossed the border back into Armenia at least once a year.  &#10;&#10;Last September this changed. Now Javakheti Armenians without Georgian citizenship can only stay in Georgia for three months at a time. Longer term residency permits are costly.  &#10;&#10;These policies breed animosity and form a perfect storm that could easily be exploited by Russia.  &#10;&#10;It does not have to be this way. Sensible policies can be pursued by Tbilisi to address the legitimate grievances of the Javakheti Armenians. The West can make it clear to Russia that further meddling in Georgia's domestic affairs could lead to additional sanctions.  &#10;&#10;The last thing the South Caucasus needs is another sectarian conflict.  	If Russia wanted to exploit the situation in Georgia's Samtskhe-Javakheti&#10;province, there's no better time than now.&#10;&#10;

This political party, drawn to victory by Marine Le Pen, won the recent French elections by almost three times the number of votes than President Francois Hollande. Although this is news, this wasn't the biggest media reaction of the day.  &#10;&#10;Ever since the news came out that the National Front's campaign budget was allegedly funded by the First Czech-Russian Bank, accusations that "the Kremlin is funding the far-right" and "supporting anti-EU parties" have been making the rounds. This bank has been in operation since 1996, which by Russian terms, makes it "ancient" as capitalism didn't really kick in until the mid-1990s in Russia. Through this, the sole owner of the bank, Roman Popov, was immediately seen as the "oligarch who is close to the Kremlin".  &#10;&#10;The funding, which initially started at a sum of $11m, quickly increased to $49m, purely because that is the amount of money the National Front said it needed in order to pay for its campaign leading up to the presidential elections in 2017.  &#10;&#10;With all the media hype, it seems as though people haven't picked up on the irony. When former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was running for president in 2005, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi also gave him a sum of money for his campaign. But that is not the irony; the amount of money he gave was $49m. This doesn't appear to have crossed the minds of western hacks just yet. That is because they have their own steadfast views and refuse to deviate from them.  &#10;&#10;In order to find out more, I turned to my Moscow sources for help. But first, I got in touch with the First Czech-Russian Bank. I wanted to find out what they thought about the whole fuss that has erupted around their institution.  &#10;&#10;Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, the staff at the bank was reluctant to comment on the loan to the National Front, citing client confidentiality. They did, however, provide me with a direct email address to get in touch with one of the deputy chairmen, who never did respond to my request for comment.  &#10;&#10;Then again, if you should try to find out something somewhat unconventional from any of the private banks in the West, you'd also be met with silence or at best, claims of data protection.  &#10;&#10;My sources in Moscow did a bit of their own research and told me that the First Czech-Russian Bank was actually launched on the initiative of the Czech government. At some point later on, one of the shareholders was the Russian construction company Stroitransgaz; translated into English, the name means "Gas Pipeline Construction". The current owner of the bank, Roman Popov, used to work there.  &#10;&#10;While Popov was head of the Finance Department (1992-2002), Stroitransgaz was a subcontractor for Gazprom, the giant state-owned gas and oil corporation in Russia. It was probably because of that, that western hacks came to the conclusion that Popov is "directly linked to the Kremlin".  &#10;&#10;The journalists' suspicions are further fuelled by the fact that Popov generally keeps a low profile and does not boast about his football club in England or his basketball team in the US or his real-estate profile, which is worth millions in Western Europe. The bank also has two representative offices; one in Prague and one in Bratislava, which would be logical if the name of your bank included the word "Czech".  &#10;&#10;My sources in Moscow informed me that the First Czech-Russian bank is quite a good bank and has a very decent track record, which is no mean feat for a financial institution that dates back to 1996. It has had no substantial bail outs from the Central Bank and survived the banking crash of 2007 with flying colours.  &#10;&#10;As for the owner, the best I could find out is that he has a degree in financial management and has been of late developing business beyond corporate entities and individual customers in Russia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. No word on why he gave the go-ahead to give the loan to the National Front, but even if he did, why not? If the interest is good and the chances of getting it back are high as well, it sounds like a fair deal. Not to mention that it's a perfectly legitimate political party, which enjoys greater support than the ruling party at present. The most recent opinion poll has shown that Le Pen would win the first round of the presidential elections if they were held tomorrow.  &#10;&#10;The question is, of course, did Popov bargain on all the publicity that his bank would be getting once word gets out that he has been funding an anti-EU and anti-immigration political part in France? Well, it might be that he thought that some publicity for his bank might actually attract more clients and raise his bank's profile. Let's face it, if a party gets 25 percent in the national vote, like the National Front did in the European elections this year, it means that a lot of people see it as a better bet than the other parties, which in turn means that the potential client base is substantial.  &#10;&#10;In Russia itself, the National Front is not seen as "racist" or "fascist", as some sections of the French media portray it. In doing so, they seem to forget that by labelling this party as racists and fascists, they also label 25 percent of the French electorate as racists and fascists.  &#10;&#10;In Russia, the National Front is considered a right-wing political party that has some sensible policies on the EU, on immigration and supports the idea of a strong French identity and closer ties with Russia.  &#10;&#10;The opposition UMP - led once again by Sarkozy - incidentally, shares some of the National Front's views on immigration and the EU. Leading Russian political expert Andrey Fursov says that "to call the National Front [headed by Marine Le Pen] a far-right or fascist party is an exaggeration and a mistake".  &#10;&#10;"It's a right-wing party, yes," he says. "In our modern times, it's the left- wing socialists who can actually be called fascists."  &#10;&#10;In his opinion, those who are called right-wing these days are "realists" who don’t want Europe to be enslaved by the US and the "Euro-bureaucracy”.  &#10;&#10;It remains to be seen whether the First Czech-Russian Bank made the right commercial move. From the point of view of PR, that is.  	No word on why the bank gave the loan to France's National Front party - but&#10;why shouldn't it?&#10;&#10;
229-russiaoverstretchingitself	aljazeera	Fri, 02 Jan 2015 08:46:34 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/01/russia-overstretching-itself-20151111531816963.html	Luke Coffey	Is Russia overstretching itself?	In 1783, Russia and the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti, which would later become part of modern day Republic of Georgia, signed the Treaty of Georgievsk. Among other things this treaty gave Kartli-Kakheti a status of a Russian protectorate. Squished between the Russian, Persian, and Ottoman Empires, this was exactly what the tiny kingdom needed…or so they thought. The deal with Russia soon turned deadly. Russia reneged on the treaty, and by 1795 Russian troops had left the region and a Persian army had invaded and leveled the capital city of Tbilisi.  &#10;&#10;Georgians have never forgotten this betrayal. When Soviet Russia marked the bicentenary of the Treaty of Georgievsk in 1983 it was met with mass protests from anti-Soviet Georgians.  &#10;&#10;The Treaty of Georgievsk might have been the first dodgy treaty Russia signed in the region but it certainly has not been the last.  &#10;&#10;Soon Russia is expected to sign a treaty with Georgia's breakaway province South Ossetia. Last November, Russia and Abkhazia - another breakaway province in Georgia - signed a treaty on "alliance and strategic partnership". This treaty established a coordinated foreign policy, the creation of a "common security and defense space" between Russia and Abkhazia, and the implementation of a streamlined process for Abkhazians to receive Russian citizenship.  &#10;&#10;The pending treaty with South Ossetia is expected to bring the relationship between South Ossetia and Russia even closer. While Abkhaz officials have shown little interest in getting annexed by Russia, many in South Ossetia would be happy with this outcome. The defacto leader of South Ossetia Leonid Tibilov said the treaty could see the tiny breakaway province "becoming a subject of the Russian Federation".  &#10;&#10;The Ossetian people are representative of the typical geographical, religious, and ethnic complexities found in the Caucasus. Ethically and linguistically they are descended from Iranians. Religiously they are Orthodox Christian. The Ossetian people are unique in the Caucasus as they are the only ethnic group found living in large numbers on both sides of the mountains.  &#10;&#10;Even so, South Ossetia does not have close links to Russia's North Ossetia as one might expect. The only road linking the two Ossetias runs through the Roki tunnel which was only completed in 1984. In fact, Tskhinvali, the administrative capital of South Ossetia, is closer to Tbilisi than it is to North Ossetia's capital city Vladikavkaz.  &#10;&#10;Since the 2008 Russian invasion of Georgia, Russia has occupied South Ossetia with thousands of troops. Almost seven years on, Russia is still in direct violation of the Six Point Ceasefire Agreement brokered by then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Russia has spent millions of dollars building a fence around the administrative boundary between South Ossetia and Georgia. In some cases, the fence cuts homes, families, and properties into half.  &#10;&#10;Russia is one of only four countries that recognise South Ossetia's independence (the others being Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Nauru). By contrast, many European countries and the United States recognise the Russian presence in South Ossetia as an illegal occupation.  &#10;&#10;Russia needs to think carefully before annexing South Ossetia. As Moscow has experienced with Crimea, annexation comes at a cost, both economically and geo-politically. Economic sanctions are starting to bite, the ruble is down, and the low price of oil is severely impacting the Russian economy. Then there are all the other costs associated with annexation: paying for pensions, local services, healthcare, education, and infrastructure - this is a heavy burden for the stagnate Russian economy.  &#10;&#10;The Georgian Foreign Ministry criticised Russia's move as a step toward "annexation of Georgia’s occupied territories". In reality, there is little Georgia can do about it. Raising international awareness and encouraging the US and Europe to link economic sanctions connected to Russia's annexation of Crimea to any possible annexation of South Ossetia is the first thing the Georgian government should do.  &#10;&#10;The history of the Caucasus has shown that allegiances have, and can, change over time. Through a long term process of confidence building measures, the Georgian government needs to show those in South Ossetia that their future is brighter with Tbilisi and in the transatlantic community than it is with Russia. Finally, Georgia must stick with its "non-use of force" pledge regarding the occupied territories. There is no military solution to either South Ossetia or Abkhazia, and the region can hardly afford another war.  &#10;&#10;It is ironic that since the early 1990s thousands of South Ossetians have died fighting for their independence from Georgia when they are likely to hand over their sovereignty to Russia. Russia's treaties with Abkhazia and South Ossetia should be seen for what they really are: the first step in a process of Russian annexation of both breakaway regions - both of which are still internationally recognised to be part of Georgia. Considering Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, Georgians have cause for concern.  	After Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, Georgians have cause for concern.&#10;&#10;
230-russiapartsolutionproblem	aljazeera	Sat, 13 Dec 2014 05:49:06 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/russia-part-solution-problem-2014121052153403842.html	Vartan Oskanian	Russia is part of the solution and the problem 	When it comes to Russia, I must admit, I have my biases. Political and economic developments in Russia have a direct impact on the Caucasus and particularly my own country, Armenia. The heightened tension between Russia and the West limits Armenia's ability to balance between two friendly sides while Russia's economic reversals impact Armenia's fragile economy. Not to mention what another Cold War might do to Armenia, to the region and the world.  &#10;&#10;I recently attended a Bertelsmann Foundation conference in Berlin on the EU's Neighbourhood Policy, where I asked the keynote speaker, former Chancellor of Austria Wolfgang Schussel, if the West could ever consider the "Finlandisation" of Ukraine as a compromise outcome to the current crisis - something that is being advocated by former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former US National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. (Finland maintained neutrality by not joining NATO during and after the Cold War.)  &#10;&#10;My enquiry generated a commotion in the hall and the Finnish representative, pre-empting the speaker, challenged my premise arguing that Finland's choice was of its own volition, which is not the case in Ukraine. Schussel concurred.  &#10;&#10;Fair point. But in international relations, a state's "volition" is so often shaped and determined by perceived threats. It's called diplomacy and it requires reconciling the pursuit of national interests with regional and global peace. Finland's President Sauli Niinisto himself, in a recent interview with the Washington Post, predicted that Finland joining NATO would negatively affect relations with Russia.  &#10;&#10;"It is very obvious that if Finland joins NATO, that would undoubtedly harm our relations with Russia. You have to keep in mind that 1,300km is a long border, and you just don't keep it closed. On the contrary, it's a living border," Niinisto said.  &#10;&#10;It's time Ukraine does the same. The world is inching towards a new Cold War and at the heart of it is Ukraine. When and what will be the last straw is hard to tell. But then it will be too late to reverse things from a point of no return.  &#10;&#10;Russia today faces serious geopolitical and economic challenges. It is in direct confrontation with the West on a vision about the world order, on Ukraine, on Syria and on a great many other large and not-so-large issues. Economically, Russia is beginning to feel the aggregate impact of the West's economic sanctions, falling oil prices, the devaluation of the ruble, capital outflow and a decline in direct foreign investment.  &#10;&#10;But to think that these pressures will force the Kremlin into even partial submission and to change its posture on global issues and weaken its grip on its immediate neighbourhood would be to misjudge President Vladimir Putin. It could have the exact opposite effect, as Russia's president perhaps walks his way out of this through consolidation at home and further assertiveness and intransigence abroad.  &#10;&#10;In his annual State of the Nation address to parliament on December 4, Putin evoked exactly that. He called for the public's resilience in the face of hardship, and promised to continue his foreign policy in the belief in the justness of Russia's cause and greatness. Russia's (or Putin's) convictions are anchored on several real or perceived premises.  &#10;&#10;Russian influence  &#10;&#10;First, Russia believes that the US never stopped containing Russia. Since the collapse of the Berlin wall, NATO's and the EU's borders have moved east. Russia fears that Ukraine's and Georgia's expressed desire to join both organisations, risks bringing those organisations to Russia's most vulnerable borders - to the east and the south.  &#10;&#10;In his address condemning the "pure cynicism" of the West, he accused western governments of seeking to raise a new "iron curtain" around Russia and suggested that even if Crimea had not been annexed, the West would have come up with a different pretext to impose sanctions to contain Russia's resurgence.  &#10;&#10;Second, Russia firmly believes that Americans are interventionists and falsely moralistic in their discourse. They are heavily involved in using soft power to manipulate and shape the will of the people while advocating the independence and sovereignty of states and respect of the will of those same people to determine their own future. In the same speech, Putin accused the West of meddling in Russia's internal affairs, claiming that sanctions were merely an excuse to weaken Russia.  &#10;&#10;Last month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov charged the West with seeking regime change in Moscow. Russia has always blamed the West for its policies of interference in other countries' internal affairs, but had never before implied that it had worries of its own.  &#10;&#10;As we are faced with the possibility of another Cold War and are challenged to look for ways to avoid it, it is worth looking into history's verdict on the original one.  &#10;&#10;Facing a Cold War  &#10;&#10;First there are the traditionalists of the 1960s who argued that the Cold War was the direct result of Stalin's aggressive Soviet expansionism. Later on, particularly during the Vietnam War, the revisionists (William Appleman Williams) challenged that view blaming the US for the Cold War, arguing that: "America's chief aim in the years after the war was to make sure that there was an 'open door' for American trade, and that this led the American government to try to make sure that countries remained capitalist like the United States."  &#10;&#10;Then there were the post-revisionists (John Lewis Gaddis) in the 1970s who believed that: "America and Russia wanted to keep the peace after the war but that conflict was caused by mutual misunderstanding, reactivity, and above all the American inability to understand Stalin's fears and need to defend himself after the war."  &#10;&#10;The latter is the closest guide to today's problems. One of the specificities of the current period is that the West considers Russia to be both part of the solution but part of the problem as well.  &#10;&#10;Indeed, Russia supports the separatists in Ukraine and is the only power that can influence decisions there and make the rebels listen. In Iran, Russia built the heavy water Arak nuclear power station which was perceived to be a huge problem, even as it offers to supply enriched uranium or host Iran's centrifuges as part of a solution. In Syria, Russia backs the Assad regime while it remains engaged in the political process and under certain circumstances can influence Assad's decisions.  &#10;&#10;The list grows even longer if one considers the conflicts in other parts of Russia's neighbourhood. From the Moldovan to the Georgian and the Armenian- Azerbaijani conflicts, Russia has a major influence and say in the final outcomes.  &#10;&#10;As a result of this duality, the line is blurred between engagement and confrontation, creating misunderstandings and uncertainties, but also opportunities for both Russia and the US. This was not the case in the East- West standoff during the Cold War.  &#10;&#10;These beliefs and perceptions are both strengths and weaknesses for one side or the other. Taken together, they nullify each other. In the bigger picture, in the face of enormous global disturbances causing untold carnage and loss of life, they seem trivial.

Kaplan	Saluting the silent heroes of the US Navy’s submarine force	(Kaplan Public Service Foundation)  &#10;&#10;Our most recent elections demonstrated Americans are still very worried about the state of the economy and their own job security. However, there is an employer looking to hire young, motivated, and intelligent men and women—the United States Navy’s submarine force.  &#10;&#10;It\'s not easy to be eligible for such employment. Officer and enlisted candidates must first graduate from rigorous nuclear engineering training or technical schools for non-nuclear enlisted rates. In addition, applicants must also pass a thorough psychological evaluation. The fortunate few that do indeed make the grade will then embark on a challenging, yet rewarding journey to become a qualified submariner.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;After this extensive training pipeline and another intensive qualification process on board an actual submarine, sailors are rewarded with “Dolphins,” the chest insignia that signifies membership to an elite brotherhood (and now sisterhood as well, since 2010) that very few individuals have the privilege to join.  &#10;&#10;On September 21, I, along with 13 other American civilians, experienced a brief glimpse into the life of a U.S. Navy submariner. As the guests of Captain Gene Doyle, the commander of Submarine Squadron 11, we were invited to embark on board the USS HAMPTON (SSN 767), a Los Angeles Class fast attack submarine in the waters near San Diego, California.  &#10;&#10;The captain of USS Hampton, a no-nonsense, highly respected commander named Lincoln Reifsteck, along with his executive officer, David Fassel and chief of the boat, Richard Moses, welcomed us on board and introduced us to a world few civilians will ever have the honor and opportunity to experience.  &#10;&#10;We soon learned that Reifsteck’s most difficult task wasn’t submerging the ship 700 feet below the ocean’s surface (the more difficult part is actually the resurfacing process in the crowded waters off San Diego) or even preparing to shoot a tomahawk missile. Instead, Reifsteck’s greatest challenge is keeping his sailors motivated, ready, and vigilant 24 hours a day, 7 days a week over a period of several months (please note, the average age of a submariner is only 22). In our short time on board USS HAMPTON, we witnessed Reifsteck’s uncanny ability to both motivate and prepare his sailors for any obstacle before them.  &#10;&#10;During 2013, the Hampton was at sea for 298 out of 365 days. That’s 82 percent of the year away from family and friends with no access to a telephone, the Internet, or the daily comforts that we as Americans have grown so accustomed to. There is a very good reason why submariners earn on average 30 percent more than other sailors.  &#10;&#10;While much of their time underway was spent on surveillance, anti-submarine and anti-surface ship warfare, the HAMPTON spent 70 days at the North Pole with a team of professors from Columbia University taking water samples for research being conducted on current and climate change.  &#10;&#10;So if you are of the mindset that submarines are all about undersea warfare or hunting the “Red October”; think again. Modern attack subs are now doing everything from the weather change research to delivering special operators ashore on covert operations.  &#10;&#10;Initially, the outside observer may get the impression that the men of the HAMPTON live a difficult and isolated life onboard a windowless tube with little or no communication with the outside world.  &#10;&#10;However, we quickly discovered that the crew thrived in this seemingly austere environment. Through our conversations with them, we came to the realization that they live by the submarine mantra of “steel ships, iron men (and women).”  &#10;&#10;The absence of windows and natural sunlight quickly became irrelevant as the ship’s electronics and sophisticated sensors became their window to the outside world.  &#10;&#10;Much like an astronaut, submariners become travelers in another medium deep below the sea. Any perceived isolation leads to a greater connection with their “shipmates” forming an everlasting bond amongst the crew.  &#10;&#10;After only one day underway, it became apparent to us that the submarine service is not for everyone—not all men and women are able to overcome the supposed “sacrifices” many civilians associate with a life at sea.  &#10;&#10;However, those individuals that successfully complete the demanding screening and training pipeline of a United States submariner, will have excellent advancement and future employment opportunities in both the military and civilian sectors.  &#10;&#10;Civilian employers are always looking to hire submariners for their technical acumen, leadership skill, and ability to operate under pressure. Those individuals that choose to leave military service are often rewarded with high paying jobs and quickly adapt and excel in the civilian workforce (the military does retain a very high percentage of these highly skilled individuals with large bonuses, special pay and the intangible sense of patriotic duty that accompanies wearing the uniform of a Navy submariner).  &#10;&#10;Sir Winston Churchill once said, “Of all the branches of men in the forces there is none which shows more devotion and faces grimmer perils than the submariners.” From our experience with the captain and crew of USS HAMPTON, we couldn’t agree more. Any danger of operating a ship under the sea was however quickly overshadowed by the competency of the sailors tasked with running America’s most stealthy and vital warships.  &#10;&#10;May God bless the officers and crew-- and their families-- of USS HAMPTON and the Silent Service.  	There is a very good reason why submariners earn on average 30 percent more&#10;than other sailors.&#10;&#10;
232-saudiarabiaanxiousideologicall	guardian	2015-01-06T13:29:40Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/06/saudi-arabia-anxious-ideological-links-isis	Brian Whitaker	Saudi Arabia is right to be anxious over its ideological links with Isis	In a pre-dawn raid on Monday, militants attacked a Saudi border post from the Iraqi side of the frontier. The resulting clash left three soldiers and four militants dead, according to the Saudi government news agency.  &#10;&#10;It later emerged that one of the dead soldiers was no ordinary border guard but the commander of Saudi Arabia’s northern border forces, Brigadier General Awdah al-Balawi. This suggests that the attack, far from being random or opportunistic, had been carefully targeted and perhaps based on inside information regarding the general’s whereabouts.  &#10;&#10;The attack has been widely attributed to Islamic State, with some reports saying the rebel group has now claimed responsibility for it. This might be viewed simply as a reprisal for Saudi participation in the US-led bombing campaign against Isis, but Isis has also been seeking to extend the current conflict in Syria and Iraq into Saudi territory.  &#10;&#10;There is no doubt that Isis has both sympathisers and active supporters inside the kingdom – it claimed responsibility for shooting a Danish citizen in Riyadh last November, for example – but whether it will be able to establish a military foothold is another question. Isis tends to flourish militarily in places where central government is weak, but that is not the case in Saudi Arabia.  &#10;&#10;In military terms, the Saudi security apparatus is probably capable of suppressing Isis on its own territory, just as it did with al-Qaeda a decade or so ago, but it is in no position to confront Isis at the ideological level. The problem here is that Isis and the Saudis’ Islamic kingdom are ideologically similar, so attempts to challenge Isis on ideological grounds risk undermining the Saudi state too. As Heba Saleh and Simeon Kerr noted in the Financial Times last September:  &#10;&#10;The underlying issue, therefore, is the rival claims of king and would-be caliph. In the words of two Saudi government supporters: “To restore the ‘caliphate’, [Isis] would ultimately need to implant itself at the epicentre of Islamic life, the two holy mosques in Mecca and Medina. Therefore, [Isis’s] road to the caliphate runs through the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.”  &#10;&#10;Inconveniently for the Saudi monarchy, this challenge from the upstart caliph comes at a time of uncertainty over the royal succession. King Abdullah, now in his 90s, is in hospital – reportedly being treated for pneumonia – and his likely successor, Crown Prince Salman, is thought to be 77 and not in good health.  &#10;&#10;So far, Saudi efforts to confront Isis ideologically have mainly taken the form of denunciations from tame clerics – figures who have no prospect of influencing Isis supporters and sympathisers – but it is difficult to see what else they might do without calling their own state system into question.  &#10;&#10;The king and his princes have dug a hole for themselves by harnessing religion in the pursuit of power. Religious credentials bolstered their claim to legitimacy and helped them assert their authority. For a long time, those credentials served them well, but now they are becoming a liability and it may be too late to unfasten the harness.  	Brian Whitaker: The Saudi authorities have condemned Islamic State, but they fear the destabilising effects of any detailed examination of their shared principles
233-saudiboldpoliticalgambit	aljazeera	Mon, 05 Jan 2015 08:04:38 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/01/saudi-bold-political-gambit-20151545814291980.html	Ibrahim Al-Marashi	Saudi's bold political gambit	Recent reports of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reopening its embassies in Baghdad and in the capital of the Kurdish Regional Government, Erbil, may appear to be an overdue, yet mundane diplomatic affair, but this news signifies a development in Saudi foreign policy to Iraq.  &#10;&#10;While diplomatic relations between Riyadh and Baghdad were severed after Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Saudi Arabia failed to reopen diplomatic facilities in Iraq as tensions ensued with the post-Baathist government. The recent news serves as an indication that Riyadh has finally come to terms with a Shia-led government in Baghdad, and is now seeking a presence in Iraq to influence developments there on an official, bilateral level.  &#10;&#10;In terms of regional power dynamics, the fall of Saddam Hussein's government in 2003 affected all of Iraq's neighbours. Jordan and Syria had to deal with an influx of Iraqi refugees. Both Syria and Iran feared the Bush administration would use Iraq as a base to destabilise their regimes. Both Turkey and Saudi Arabia feared that the empowered Kurds and Shia in Iraq after 2003 would foment similar aspirations among their respective Kurdish and Shia populations.  &#10;&#10;Contentious issue  &#10;&#10;The reopening of embassies in Baghdad after the US-led occupation had been a contentious issue for regional actors in the Middle East. The new politicians in Iraq had to urge various Arab states and organisations to reopen their embassies in Baghdad in order to bestow some regional legitimacy upon a nascent Iraqi government.  &#10;&#10;The Arab League hesitated reopening its diplomatic facilities in Baghdad as an indirect way of protesting the fact that an Arab capital was under foreign control.  &#10;&#10;Baghdad repeatedly asked Syria to open up its embassy in Baghdad, hoping that diplomatic relations would end Syria's policy of granting refuge to former Baathists and supporting the Iraqi insurgency immediately following the 2003 invasion.  &#10;&#10;For Saudi Arabia, the failure to open an embassy in Baghdad had less to do with the presence of US forces occupying an Arab capital, but rather as a means of protesting the rise of a new Shia-led government in Iraq.  &#10;&#10;After the Iranian Revolution of 1979, Saudi Arabia's Shia began to protest, demanding more rights from the Saudi government, and the fear in Riyadh was that the ascent of a Shia-led government in Iraq could ignite similar protests in 2003. Saudi Arabia's fears of renewed unrest among its Shia population in its oil-rich Eastern province is an internal domestic issue. However, the Iraq War of 2003 also represented a foreign policy setback on the regional level.  &#10;&#10;Iranian influence  &#10;&#10;Iraq under Saddam Hussein, even a weak Iraq after 1991, still served as a buffer against Iran, which had rivalled Riyadh for regional hegemony in the Middle East and the greater Islamic world since 1979, fighting proxy wars from Lebanon to Pakistan. After 2003, Saudi Arabia watched as Iran's influence grew in Iraq, which was backing Baghdad's first Shia-led government, in addition to Tehran influencing events in the Houthi rebellion in Yemen, another state Saudi Arabia considers as its backyard.  &#10;&#10;Not only had Iranian influence outflanked Saudi Arabia on both sides of its borders, but from the perspective of Riyadh, the Arab Spring protests of Bahrain were deemed as an Iranian-backed project. Finally, Iran seemed on the verge of not only acquiring a nuclear programme, but also reaching at least a de facto working relationship with the US in the region.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;While Saudi Arabia was initially reluctant to challenge the status quo by supporting the protests and rebellion against Syria's Bashar al-Assad, it weighed in on the side of the rebels, and in this proxy war, Iran also defeated Saudi aspirations by keeping the incumbent government in Damascus alive.  &#10;&#10;The regional situation in the Middle East has been described by Richard Haass, President of the Council on Foreign Relations, as the Middle Eastern Thirty Years War, or as a new sectarian Cold War waged by Iran and Saudi Arabia.  &#10;&#10;If one were to use either analogy, then Iran is definitely winning this conflict. From this perspective, the news of reopening the Saudi embassies emerges in the context of a reassessment of Riyadh's foreign policy, released at a fortuitous time as King Abdullah is hospitalised and worries emerge of what this means for the future leadership of the Kingdom.  &#10;&#10;Quiet diplomacy  &#10;&#10;However, the decision to reopen the embassies reflect a sustained period of quiet diplomacy that preceded the king's health condition. The first indication that Iran and Saudi Arabia were beginning to cooperate over Iraq's future occurred after the ISIL offensive into Mosul in the summer of 2014. Both Tehran and Riyadh agreed on Haider al-Abbadi as a replacement to Iraq's incumbent Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki. This agreement represents an evolution from the Saudi side, as evident from a Wikileaks cable where King Abdullah expressed his personal dislike of Maliki in a meeting with US officials  &#10;&#10;On the bilateral Iraqi and Saudi level, a thaw in relations occurred after Iraq's president visited Riyadh and met with the king in November 2014, and a Saudi-Iraqi agreement was reached to combat ISIL. This agreement is significant given the number of Iraqis in both the state and society who blame the rise of ISIL on Saudi Arabia in the first place as the financial and ideological incubator of this group. For example, Iraqi public service announcements encouraged Iraqis to inform on "foreign" terrorists, invoking an image of a bearded man with a short thobe, handing out funds to local Iraqis, to stir up problems in Iraq.  &#10;&#10;It appears that Iraq, Iran, and Saudi Arabia have come to the conclusion that when it comes to combatting ISIL, all three parties need to reach a modus vivendi. If one chooses to employ short hand monikers to describe the state of affairs in the region, rather than a "Thirty Years War" or a "Cold War", regional actors in the Middle East have finally come to an agreement that they are waging their own "War on Terror" against ISIL.  	The reopening of Saudi embassies in Iraq reflects a fundamental reassessment&#10;of Riyadh's foreign policy.&#10;&#10;

For “erratic,” the lesson included this statement: “The responses to Muhammad’s teachings were at first erratic. Some people responded favorably, while other resisted his claim that ‘there is no God but Allah and Muhammad his Prophet.”  &#10;&#10;Another section required students to complete a sentence:  &#10;&#10;“There are such vast numbers of people who are anxious to spread the Muslim faith that it would be impossible to give a(n)___ amount.”  &#10;&#10;I spoke to one parent who asked not to be identified. She was extremely troubled by what her child was exposed to in the classroom.  &#10;&#10;“What if right after Pearl Harbor our educational system was talking about how great the Japanese emperor was?” the parent asked. “What if during the Cold War our educational system was telling students how wonderful Russia was?”  &#10;&#10;The parent said the material was classwork disguised as Islamic propaganda.  &#10;&#10;“It’s very shocking,” she said. “I just told my daughter to read it as if it’s fiction. It’s no different than another of fictional book you’ve read.”  &#10;&#10;A spokesman for Pitt County Schools defended the lesson – noting that it came from a state-adopted supplemental workbook and met the “Common Core standards for English Language Arts.”  &#10;&#10;“The course is designed to accompany the world literature text, which emphasizes culture in literature,” the statement read.  &#10;&#10;The problem is it’s emphasizing a specific culture and religion – and the school district acknowledged there were concerns “related to the religious nature of sentences providing vocabulary words in context.”  &#10;&#10;“Our school system understands all concerns related to proselytizing, and there is no place for it in our instruction,” the statement goes on to say. “However, this particular lesson was one of many the students in this class have had and will have that expose them to the various religions and how they shape cultures throughout the world.”  &#10;&#10;I asked the school district to provide me with a copy of vocabulary worksheets that promoted the Jewish, Hindu and Christian faiths.  &#10;&#10;The school district did not reply.  &#10;&#10;I also asked for the past or future dates when the students would be given those vocabulary worksheets.  &#10;&#10;The school district has yet to reply.  &#10;&#10;The student I spoke with told me they have not had any other assignments dealing with religion – other than the one about Islam.  &#10;&#10;Why is that not surprising?  &#10;&#10;Based on its official statement, Pitt County Schools seems confident that the vocabulary lessons are in compliance with three Common Core standards related to literacy. If you want to look up those standards, reference CCSSELA- Literary L11-12.4.A, 12.4.D and 12.6.  &#10;&#10;Since the Common Core folks seem to be infatuated with sentence completion – let me try one out on them.  &#10;&#10;Use “Islamic” and “proselytizing” in the following sentence: Somebody got their ____ hand caught in the ____ cookie jar.  &#10;&#10;UPDATE: I asked the school district if there had been similar vocabulary assignments about Judaism, Christianity or other religions. I also asked for the exact dates of those assignments. Here’s the reply I received from the school district:  &#10;&#10;"The class recently finished reading Night by Elie Wiesel. As part of the study of this book, students were exposed to Judaism. I\'m told that one of the next couple of lessons that will be taught in this class includes an examination of Psalm 23 as part of the lesson. Additionally, the workbook in question has another vocabulary lesson with words used in a passage about India\'s three great beliefs (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism). Keep in mind that this workbook is just one of numerous resources used in the course. Students are exposed to various cultures, values, and beliefs through the reading of multiple types of literature, but teachers certainly aren\'t advocating for any of them.”  &#10;&#10;Notice how the school district dodged my question?  	Parents in Farmville, North Carolina want to know why their children were&#10;given a Common Core vocabulary assignment in an English class that promoted&#10;Muhammad and the Islamic faith.&#10;&#10;

(AP/Paramount Pictures)  &#10;&#10;Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. died young — at age 39 — and ever since his assassination in 1968 there has been a contest over his legacy.  &#10;&#10;I’ve met black radicals who sneer at the national holiday celebrating his birth. They see the King holiday as white America’s preference for celebrating a moderate, non-violent black leader instead of a militant, violent young Malcolm X.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;On the other side are critics who see the King holiday as political correctness taken to new heights. King was not a president, like Washington and Lincoln, so they ask why he is deserving of a national holiday. Blinded by racial bitterness, they suggest President Reagan signed the King holiday into law in 1983 as a token political gesture.  &#10;&#10;Now a very good, emotionally powerful new movie — “Selma” — about Dr. King’s historic role in the struggle for voting rights has set off a new fight over his legacy.  &#10;&#10;This dramatic film by director, Ava DuVernay, will be remembered less as a record of Dr. King’s greatness and more as a sign of the racial power struggles of the early 21st century.  &#10;&#10;I know the real civil rights story. I’ve written two best-selling histories of the period. The greatest social movement of the last century belongs to all Americans. But some people prefer to play racial games.  &#10;&#10;This movie fits in with the racially divisive discussion about who owns the history of the civil rights movement. It fits with polarizing racial figures like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. They regularly exploit the history of the civil rights movement for their own personal gain — hosting television shows and getting money from corporations — while not doing the hard work of addressing high rates of black crime, school dropouts and family breakdown.  &#10;&#10;It is also fits with many white politicians who blame the poor for every problem and find it easy to push minority voters out of their districts while ignoring the nation’s history of denying black people the right to vote.  &#10;&#10;Now a version of the same race hustle is on display in Hollywood. To celebrate King as a hero, the director, who is black decided to make President Lyndon Johnson into a white villain.  &#10;&#10;In one scene Johnson erupts in anger at Dr. King, telling the civil rights leader, “You’ve got one big issue, I’ve got one hundred and one.” People who were in the room, black and white aides to the president and Dr. King, say no such confrontation ever happened.  &#10;&#10;The movie also has Johnson approving of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover’s scheme to send Dr. King’s wife an audio recording of her husband having sex with another woman. The historical record is clear. Yes, the tape is real. No, Johnson had nothing to do it. And the tape had nothing to do with events in Selma.  &#10;&#10;All of that is what Bill Moyers called “the worst kind of creative license suggesting the very opposite of the truth.”  &#10;&#10;And when the director, DuVernay, was called on the distortion, she said people who care about history are the problem. She argued that crediting Johnson with supporting the Selma march was “jaw-dropping and offensive” and amounted to ignoring “black citizens who made it so.” To her, the fact that Johnson explicitly endorsed the idea of taking the movement to Selma in a recorded phone call to Dr. King is just a nuisance.  &#10;&#10;White directors have similarly distorted civil rights history. The 1988 film “Mississippi Burning” featured two heroes, both white and both FBI agents. That was an incredible distortion of a story about the bravery of civil rights workers who dared to go south to stand with beleaguered black heroes against racial oppression. In truth, the FBI was often in league with local police departments in covering up racially motivated murder.  &#10;&#10;In 1988 that distortion was rationalized as a smart box office decision to offer white heroes to white audiences.  &#10;&#10;Now that a black director has a chance to make Hollywood’s first big movie about Dr. King, she sees it as time for payback and her own brand of distortion.  &#10;&#10;Race retains a powerful grip on American guilt, fear, lust and anger. That’s why controlling the narrative is so important. And the key to the narrative is in the facts of slavery, legal segregation and the fight for equal rights. That is why facts about Dr. King are subject to a constant power struggle. DuVernay is saying she will tell her story as a black story for black audiences with a black hero, and she will twist facts as she pleases.  &#10;&#10;Mark Twain said: “Get your facts first, then you can distort them as much as you please.”  &#10;&#10;The facts are that mostly white students went south for Freedom Summer; white ministers and rabbis took great risks and even died for the cause; white government officials like John Doar and Nicholas Katzenbach put themselves between racist mobs and black people. None of this diminishes the contributions of black people.  &#10;&#10;The truth is that President Johnson worked to make the movement a success. The president famously brought tears to Dr. King’s eyes in 1965 when he told a joint session of Congress and a television audience of 70 million that every American should stand up for equal voting rights. “Their cause must be our cause, too,” the president said. “Because it’s not just Negroes, but it’s really all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice.”  &#10;&#10;And then, in a rhetorical crescendo, the president said: “And we shall overcome.” He used a phrase that told the nation he was on the side of civil rights for black people. As the author of a history of the civil rights movement, “Eyes on the Prize — America’s Civil Rights Years,” I’ve done enough research to know that any fair account of the great social movement has to acknowledge Lyndon Baines Johnson as a civil rights hero.  &#10;&#10;And Dr. King doesn’t need to have anyone put down so he can look heroic. He really is a hero. That’s a fact.  	Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. died young – at age 39 – and ever since his&#10;assassination in 1968 there has been a contest over his legacy.&#10;&#10;

(AP Photo/Alan Diaz)  &#10;&#10;Five years ago, I went on a search to answer the question: What can people do to have a happy, fulfilling, lifelong marriage? I sought out an unusual source of information, however. I didn’t ask psychologists or consult self-help gurus.  &#10;&#10;Instead, I decided to go to the people with the most experience: older Americans who have been married 50, 60, 70 years and more (described in my recent book, "30 Lessons for Loving" (Hudson Street Press, January 8, 2015). I believed that the view from the finish line of marriage would be uniquely valuable – and I wasn’t disappointed. America’s elders provided a treasure trove of lessons, tips, and advice for how to find the right mate and keep the spark alive over decades.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Here are seven things they would like younger people to know – from those who are looking for a relationships to those who are in one and striving to make it last “as long as you both shall live.”  &#10;&#10;1\. Marriage is hard. Even though this is not on the minds of couples getting engaged or standing at the altar, the elders want you to know that marriage is hard. It’s tough – both because of the range of stresses and problems that confront all couples, but also because of the fundamental difficulty of merging two separate and different people into one single life. I learned that they see marriage as a discipline, like becoming an athlete or a musician – you never reach perfection, you are constantly learning, and you sacrifice short-term gain for something more rewarding later on.  &#10;&#10;2\. But marriage for a lifetime is worth it. Being with someone for a half century or more, they told me, is incredibly good. It is a sublime experience, a connection to another person unlike any other relationship. The elders describe it as the experience of a lifetime. For people who make it, it even beats the heart-pounding passion of falling in love for the first time. So making a marriage last may be hard, but the elders also want young people to know that it’s worth the effort.  &#10;&#10;4\. Think small. What can you do to keep the spark alive and the marriage interesting for decades? The elders advise you to think small. The view from the end tells you that a marriage is made up of hundreds of daily interactions. In each of those you have a chance to be positive, to be cheerful, to be supportive. They suggest that you make a habit of doing small, positive things. One idea that came up often is doing your partner’s chore. Say it’s 6 AM on a cold, rainy morning, the dog is scratching on the bedroom door, and it’s your partner’s turn to walk him – but you get up and do it. That’s money in the bank for the relationship.  &#10;&#10;5\. Talk, Talk, Talk. The elders believe that many marital problems can be solved through open communication. One man put it colorfully: “Keep yapping at one another.” According to the elders, the strong, silent type may be initially attractive – but probably doesn’t make the best marriage partner. As one 80-something told me: “If you can’t communicate, you’re just two dead ducks.”  &#10;&#10;6\. Stop trying to change your partner. When you are getting serious about someone, the elders say you must accept your partner as is, or don\'t get married. You should never say to yourself: “After we’re married, she or he will lose weight/get a job/like my family/change heart about having kids” – or any other behavior or attitude you don’t like. Instead, ask yourself: “Can I live with this trait for a lifetime. And at any point in a relationship, making your partner a do-it-yourself project only leads to anger and disappointment.  &#10;&#10;7\. Are we hungry? Here’s one that surprised me. When a couple is having an argument that threatens to become a truly major blow-up, the elders suggest that what you may need is – a sandwich. That’s right: these long-married folks say that you should never argue on an empty stomach. Offer your partner something to eat when he or she is about to fly off the handle. According to the elders, rather than a therapist you may sometimes need a pastrami sandwich or a piece of pie.

Belfies. Cock shots. Instagrammed abs. WhatsApp filth chats. Cam-to- cam sessions with strangers in Rio (or Hull) Xtube videos of faceless, face- sitting civil servants. Can I take your number, asks modern Britain, I’ll send you a six-minute film of me masturbating.  &#10;&#10;We’re all porn stars now. Technology hasn’t merely flung off religion’s centuries-long chastity belt but also provided live footage of people in suburban bedrooms flinging off chastity belts, metaphorically and literally. Google it. You’ll be horrified by their choice of curtains.  &#10;&#10;The pornification of contemporary life is so vast and so sudden we have had no time to quantify it, or even behold it. But there is deepening concern that the reduction and commodification of human beings to mere body parts – walking, talking sex toys – is having a greater effect on gay men. Russell T Davies, a screenwriter of remarkable gifts who does not so much hold a mirror up to societal sensibilities as kick them into our retinas, thinks so. He straddles the subject in his latest, much heralded gay dramas: Cucumber, Banana and Tofu.  &#10;&#10;In an interview with the Radio Times he worries that texting penis pictures “is the most normal thing in the world” among gay men, with bleak consequences. “That’s the grammar! That’s flirting! That’s extraordinary, isn’t it? That’s got to create body pressures, hasn’t it?” he added.  &#10;&#10;It certainly will not help, nestled in an increasingly narcissistic wider culture that glistens puddle-deep as we regard our reflections. But how much we should worry, and how grave the impact is on gay people – already suffering worse mental health – depends on how closely we frame Davies’ perspective. If gay people existed only online or on phones – deriving their sense of self wholly from reactions to their online sex ads – then yes, this could be catastrophic.  &#10;&#10;But they do not. And if we pan out and rewind to the gay scene of the early 90s, before Davies’ Queer as Folk awoke middle England to the wonders of rimming, gay life was no less harsh.  &#10;&#10;I was 16 and skinny when I first stepped into a gay bar in 1993. Before websites and phone apps, pubs and clubs were much more sexualised than today. No amount of online objectification compares to, say, the Brief Encounter, a long narrow bar in central London, in which one could consider it an achievement to order a pint without a stranger’s finger inserting itself somewhere.  &#10;&#10;The other great difference was the message blaring out across gay culture: you are only desirable if you are an Adonis – a “Muscle Mary”: no pecs, no sex. Many felt unwelcome, inadequate. It was, say some, a reaction to the extreme wasting suffered by thousands during the Aids crisis. I remember the dire contrast – a crowd of pumped-up tits and, in the corner, a wheelchair cradling a still-breathing skeleton. People turned away in terror. And then ran to the gym.  &#10;&#10;Now, thanks to mobiles and the internet, there is a new message: different body shapes are desirable. Plump, hairy bear? There is a market for you. Older? Click here. Skinny? Hipsters are waiting for you.  &#10;&#10;Yes, if you spend mere moments on Grindr or Scruff you will find a QC, a builder or a nurse reduced to a thumbnail fuck-me photo (it’s all terribly dignified), but there is at least some appreciation of diversity.  &#10;&#10;Progress bumbles, faltering before forging ahead. This happened with gay rights, and it will happen with gay culture. Many might sext but will also consider what it means and how it feels. The wellbeing and mental health of LGBT people has never been so prominent in conversation – just as relevant services are cut. We are, at last, contemplating the internal damage from homophobic hostility.  &#10;&#10;It is no wonder we crave distraction. We just need to put our phones down long enough to ask for support, for such services to be reinstated, and to ask those who bully, degrade and derail equality: why do you hate us? They are often easy to find. They’re the married ones lurking in gay chat rooms with their faces concealed.  	Patrick Strudwick: Russell T Davies, the man behind Cucumber, Banana and Tofu, shouldn’t worry so much about pornification – gay men don’t exist only in the virtual world
238-sexworkershumanrights	aljazeera	Mon, 08 Dec 2014 02:08:40 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/sex-workers-human-rights-201412882622177228.html	Sonja Dolinsek 	The rights of sex workers	In a case brought by three sex workers, the Supreme Court of Canada, in December 2013, struck down three provisions of the Canadian prostitution law, because they violated sex workers' human and "constitutional right to security of the person" by imposing "dangerous conditions on prostitution". In June 2014, the Canadian government introduced a new prostitution law, Bill C-36 "Protection of Communities and Exploited Persons Act", which entered into force on December 5.  &#10;&#10;While the Supreme Court had created the space for a radical change in the approach to sex work by reaffirming that human and constitutional rights apply to sex workers too, democratic procedures in Canada seem to have failed sex workers. The Canadian Pivot Legal Society argues that Bill C-36 has been "consistently misrepresented" and that it "will result in sweeping criminalisation of the sex industry", including sex workers themselves. Others have called it a "hate law", because the safety and security of sex workers was, in fact, not the priority for some who voted for the Bill C-36. One of the Senators, Donald Plett, clearly stated his priority in this regard: "We don't want to make life safe for prostitutes; we want to do away with prostitution."  &#10;&#10;Canada is not the only state that has passed questionable legislation on sex work. "[S]tates frequently deny sex workers the same human and legislative rights and protections afforded to other workers and citizens," says sex work researcher Jay Levy.  &#10;&#10;The question is: How do human rights apply to sex workers and what laws and policies should states make? How should sex work laws look like, if human rights are to be respected to the fullest extent? The answer to these questions is controversial - both philosophically and politically. In the past year, numerous countries have put sex work policies on their political agenda - for different reasons and with different goals and outcomes.  &#10;&#10;There are numerous examples worldwide, where the courts have upheld sex workers' human rights and questioned existing prostitution laws or filled legal grey areas. In New Zealand, where sex work is decriminalised, a sex worker won a case for sexual harassment against a brothel owner. In New York, 1,900 strip club dancers won a labour rights case against their employer, who will have to pay them at least $10m in compensation. Recently an Austrian court has ruled that the cost of forced health checks imposed on sex workers had to be reimbursed.  &#10;&#10;Both in Germany and in Austria, court rulings abolished to notion of prostitution as being "immoral", thus opening up the space for legal reform and the recognition of sex work as work. The European Court of Justice has repeatedly ruled that "prostitution" is an "economic activity" and that within the European Union member states cannot restrict "freedom of movement", not even for sex workers.  &#10;&#10;While court rulings are useful and necessary in reminding us that sex workers have rights too, relying solely on courts to read human rights into existing legislation cannot be the sole answer to injustices that sex workers face. Democracies need to step in to make laws that actually improve sex workers' lives - a goal that has proven difficult to reach.  &#10;&#10;Historically marginalised and stigmatised, sex workers have a hard time in pushing for a reform of prostitution laws. Most politicians, especially if male and heterosexual, do not wish to be associated with sex work.  &#10;&#10;Prejudices and lack of knowledge about the topic as well as the unwillingness to engage with sex workers themselves have proven to be hard obstacles to surmount. Often, sex workers are heard in consultation processes, but their views and political claims aren't always taken seriously.  &#10;&#10;By contrast, anti-prostitution activists calling for a world without prostitution have been far more successful in their lobbying efforts against sex work. They also explicitly distance themselves from self-identified sex workers, who they often accuse of being nothing but criminals. Using the stigma of sex work, anti-prostitution activists have managed to ally themselves with mostly sexually and socially conservative groups in their call for the suppression of sex work.  &#10;&#10;By using slogans like "end demand" or "abolish prostitution now", they have been calling for the so-called "Swedish Model", in which the act of selling sex is formally decriminalised, while clients are charged with a monetary fine. By increasing the cost of a sexual transaction, the law should work as a deterrent. A variation of the law has been implemented in other small countries, such as Norway, Iceland, and, most recently, Northern Ireland. Supporters of this approach claim that only this particular law will reduce human trafficking as well as prostitution.  &#10;&#10;However, the Swedish approach comes with many flaws and open questions. Because its goal is a society without sex workers, the law does not intend to provide any guidance on the laws we need in a society with sex workers. Norway is considering repealing the law, as the evaluation of the law has not been able to prove its success. While the EUROSTAT report on human trafficking does not point to a decrease in human trafficking in Sweden, sex workers' working conditions have worsened. In fact, the "Swedish Approach" criminalises any attempt to create safe working environments for sex workers, as anyone renting indoor space to sex workers can be charged with "pimping".  &#10;&#10;Ironically, this provision has not reduced pimping, but induced many landlords to put sex workers on the streets in order to avoid a fine for "pimping", as the so-called "Operation homeless" has shown in Norway. Furthermore, Sweden does not allow immigration for the purposes of prostitution and has been deporting migrant sex workers, who are still seen a problem of public order and security. It wasn't until 2011 that a Swedish Court ruled that deporting citizens of the European Union selling sex in Sweden was illegal. Last but not least, even Sweden and Norway tax income from sex work, while refusing to recognise it as labour.  &#10;&#10;As empirical studies on the implementation of the "Swedish approach" show, its weaknesses in guaranteeing sex workers' human rights, policy-makers also have become sceptical. A Special Committee of French Senate excluded the provision criminalising clients from the proposed new prostitution law in summer 2014 - based on the recommendations of the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights. So far, it is unclear whether France will go forward with the law at all. Britain has also excluded the provision criminalising the purchase of sex from its "Modern Slavery Bill", which has itself been criticised by NGOs for not doing justice to victims of human trafficking. Germany is also working to reform its prostitution law.  &#10;&#10;The Global Network of Sex Work Projects advocates "decriminalisation" of sex work. So far, only New Zealand has chosen "decriminalisation" as sex work policy, but maybe India will be next. India's chair of the National Commission of Women, Lalitha Kumaramangalam, recently stated that the "Immoral Traffic Prevention Act" should be revised in order to create "conditions conductive for sex workers to live with dignity".  &#10;&#10;In fact, the existing law casts sex workers simultaneously as dangerous to society and as victims to be forcefully protected from their own choices. Either way, they are not recognised as equal citizens, workers, and members of a social and political community with human rights. By decriminalising sex work, India would set an example for other countries, too. As a law practitioner recently pointed out that "the position of defining prostitution itself as inherently exploitative and a form of violence against women does not allow people in prostitution to access their right to earn a livelihood through sex work."  &#10;&#10;It is time for democracies to include sex workers in policy-making processes and take them seriously - not just because democratic values mandate it, but because sex workers are the experts on the matter.  	Countries around the world do not have proper legislation on prostitution that&#10;defends sex workers' rights.&#10;&#10;
239-siavideopopmusicnotpaedophilia	guardian	2015-01-11T09:26:46Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/11/sia-video-pop-music-not-paedophilia	Barbara Ellen	Sia’s video: let’s be wary of seeing paedophilia everywhere	Australian musician Sia has apologised to anyone “triggered” by her video for Elastic Heart, featuring Shia LaBeouf and 12-year-old dance prodigy Maggie Ziegler, dancing together, in flesh-coloured outfits (Ziegler sporting a platinum Sia wig), in a cage. The video has caused uproar in some quarters. Fame-averse Sia (who generally performs with her face hidden) tweeted: “I anticipated some ‘paedophilia!!!’ cries for this video. All I can say is Maddie and Shia are two of the only actors I felt could play these two warring ‘Sia self states’”, adding that her intention was to “create some emotional content, not to upset anybody”.  &#10;&#10;The video is jarring. Famously troubled LaBeouf and Ziegler dance around, wrestling, attacking, playing. At one point, LaBeouf holds Ziegler aloft; at another, he tries to stroke her and she kicks and hisses to get away. Elsewhere, Ziegler wraps her tiny limbs around LaBeouf in a feral grip. Watching it, I realised that the intensity (Sia’s “emotional content”) was the reason it was jarring – the mere fact that the video wasn’t carefully benign, cheaply titillating or just plain boring, like so much else in the genre. In Elastic Heart, the grown man and the young girl are alive with feelings for each other, running the gamut from amusement and play through to fury to despair. What isn’t there is sexuality. In fact, it baffles me how anyone could look seriously at Elastic Heart and claim to see any sexual content whatsoever.  &#10;&#10;Can’t a grown man and a young girl produce art with edge and beauty of any kind without a squalid sexual subtext instantly being read into it? Sia seemed to apologise for potentially triggering memories of child sex abuse and grooming (as some accused her of doing, on behalf of abuse victims). Of course we all sympathise with abuse victims. However, one would imagine that such triggers would be everywhere – perhaps mainly focused on the most ordinary and domestic of situations. All of which couldn’t be further away from a highly choreographed performance of an arty cage dance.  &#10;&#10;If some abuse survivors were genuinely disturbed by Elastic Heart then fair enough, but what about those who referred to it as an excuse for their own unease? Are these people aware that Ziegler performed solo, dressed identically, dancing similarly, for Sia’s Chandelier video. Did this talented young dancer remind them of child sex abuse then? If not, is it because LaBeouf was in Elastic Heart – so presumably a woman performing the same dance with Ziegler would have been perfectly fine. Is this where we are now: society flinching from the sight of a man and a girl performing together in any way that hasn’t been entirely emotionally neutered?  &#10;&#10;Ultimately, this discomfort seems wrapped up in our own dirty, addled, increasingly paranoid 21st-century mindset, in which paedophilia, once so grotesquely secretive, is now seen everywhere and in the most kneejerk fashion. No one could complain about increased awareness of abuse, which means that children are finally protected and believed. Such instincts come from a good (better informed) place. However, the situation has surely become overcooked when paedophilia becomes one of the first things we presume and in the most ludicrous settings.  &#10;&#10;It becomes so that everything, even art, is expected to distil and accommodate all the retrospective guilt of bygone eras: the fact that so many perpetrators of the past weren’t caught, that we were lax, not observant or protective enough. In some ways, it’s good not to forget; in others, perhaps we need to get past it. The latter is true of Elastic Heart – a video found to be offensive because of sanctioned hysteria, rather than anything happening on screen – all the more disturbing when set against the wider background of any artist being scared into silence or self-censorship. Sia should not have been badgered into an apology. She had nothing to apologise for.  &#10;&#10;Russia has listed transsexual and transgender people as no longer being allowed to qualify for driving licences. They are to be classed as having “mental disorders”, which would also include exhibitionism, voyeurism and fetishism of any kind (others include compulsive gambling and stealing).  &#10;&#10;The official line is that this is because there are too many road accidents in Russia and tightening medical controls has become necessary. However, Russian psychiatrists and human rights lawyers have condemned the move, which appears to follow on from the infamous 2013 legislation that made the promotion of “non-traditional lifestyles” illegal.  &#10;&#10;Barring a person from driving for no good reason is a serious matter. It takes away not only a civilian right but also a prime symbol of adult autonomy; never mind the real logistical difficulties that being car-less might present in parts of Russia. It also means that people who might feel that they’d benefit from some degree of psychiatric counselling would feel less inclined to do so if they feared losing their cars.  &#10;&#10;What a farce. There are some of us who would like it proved that a certain Vladimir Putin is mentally fit to ride that horse he is often (and so sexily!) perched upon. There are shots I’ve seen where he looks quite thrillingly “barking”, bobbing about on his saddle, with no top on, brandishing a rifle like the big he-man he oh so obviously is.  &#10;&#10;More seriously, this reminds us that it’s still important to keep abreast of Russian moves such as these. Big and small, these laws represent blatant targeting of minorities and cynical affronts to international human rights. This latest one is yet another shift towards the blanket criminalisation of anything other than blessed, state-ordained heterosexuality. We must keep watching.  &#10;&#10;I go pretty low with television, lower than is dignified. But even I have never watched The Jump, the Channel 4 reality show where low-rent celebrities compete in a variety of winter sports, with the slowest two each week being made to perform a ski jump to decide who will be eliminated.  &#10;&#10;There are always casualties during training. This time, Ola Jordan, of Strictly Come Dancing, injured her knee so badly that it threatens her dancing career. The Speaker’s wife, Sally Bercow, also injured herself – her ribs, not her gob, so she’ll be able to carry on just fine.  &#10;&#10;We all accept this kind of caper as “normal”, but on what premise is such dangerous and sadistic television justified? I thought Splash! was irresponsible (unfit semi-famous people falling off high-diving boards after minimal training). But ski jumping – are they kidding?  &#10;&#10;A test of mettle, my derriere; this is Lord of the Flies with frostbite. Why don’t programme makers go the whole hog and push C-listers into fast-moving traffic and allow viewers to vote on who gets squelched by an articulated lorry the fastest? If people dislike celebrities, then fine, but breaking their bones should be off limits.  	Barbara Ellen: There’s nothing seedy about Sia’s new single.

(AP)  &#10;&#10;The December issue of the Journal of Family Psychology contains no fewer than five research papers documenting religion’s positive impact on family relationships. Reading them reminds me of why I take my Christian faith seriously and the single reason I celebrate Christmas.  &#10;&#10;What’s that reason?  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;It’s not the wonderful lights, decorations, and music – all of which surely do help brighten our spirits and the short days of winter.  &#10;&#10;It’s not watching kids’ faces when they lay eyes on Santa or receive the toys they wanted.  &#10;&#10;It’s not even the seeming overall increase in generosity and loving-kindness in the public square at this time of year.  &#10;&#10;All those aspects of Christmas are precious to me. But the reason I celebrate the holiday is this: Jesus’s ministry not only changed the world 2,000 years ago, it’s transforming lives to this very day.  &#10;&#10;The essential Christian message of a loving, forgiving God is, at this very moment, healing broken people and families all over the world in ways that deserve to be called miraculous.  &#10;&#10;I could detail many true accounts of such glorious makeovers, but I’ll settle for telling you just one. It’s the story of how I myself wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for the positive impact of Christianity on my family.  &#10;&#10;It begins with my maternal grandmother, Michaela Batallan (pronounced bah-tah- YAN), who defined “liberated woman” long before the political movement of the Sixties. We grandkids called her “Titi.”  &#10;&#10;Titi was born in 1896 into a well-to-do Catholic family in Ciego de Avila, Camaguey, Cuba. When she was a young woman, she and her sisters emigrated to the United States all by themselves. They ended up living in Southern California.  &#10;&#10;High-spirited, Titi liked to party and, one day at a dance, she met a tall, handsome ladies’ man named Guadalupe Armendariz. Born in Guadalajara, Mexico, he himself liked to drink and have fun. He didn’t go to church. He didn’t believe in God.  &#10;&#10;When Titi was 28, she married Guadalupe, who by then owned a shoe repair shop in Saticoy, California. When they had children – starting with Betty (my mom), Carlos, and Yolanda – Titi gave up partying and began attending a Pentecostal church. It infuriated my grandfather, who demanded that she stop indulging in such religious mumbo-jumbo.  &#10;&#10;She didn’t obey.  &#10;&#10;When Carlos was seven, he was stricken with polio and eventually couldn’t walk. One day, out of desperation, Titi invited the minister and people from her church to come to the house and pray for healing. My grandfather was not happy; he wanted my grandmother to take Carlos to the Children’s Hospital in Los Angeles for treatment. But that day, he witnessed something he couldn’t believe nor explain.  &#10;&#10;After the praying was done, Carlos immediately stood straight up and from that day onward was no longer paralyzed. My grandfather, seeing it happen with his own eyes, fell to his knees. He was never the same man again.  &#10;&#10;My grandfather stopped drinking and partying and began attending church. In 1932, the entire family – my grandpa included – were baptized.  &#10;&#10;Not long afterwards, the family moved to Azusa, California, where my grandfather felt called to become a minister. With the help of his young sons – Titi and he ended up having eight children: four boys, four girls – he built a church with his own hands, using materials he collected from around the neighborhood. It’s still standing. Years later, Grandpa Lupe’s ministry was so successful his sermons were broadcast on the radio.  &#10;&#10;By and by, he accepted an invitation from my paternal grandfather – Dr. Miguel Guillén, after whom I’m named – to join the Latin American Council of Christian Churches (LACCC), of which Grandpa Guillén was president. Later, Titi stepped up and founded a sister organization – the Pro-Seminario – to raise funds for the LACCC’s fledgling seminary.  &#10;&#10;Just two weeks ago, in Galveston, Texas, I had the honor of preaching at the biennial convention of the LACCC. At ninety-one, it’s the oldest, independent, Spanish-speaking Pentecostal organization in the country, with hundreds of churches in the United States, Mexico, and Central America. I and the many others who attended the convention also had the joy of celebrating the 60th anniversary of LACCC’s seminary, which Grandma Titi helped to build.  &#10;&#10;Clearly, I don’t need the Journal of Family Psychology to tell me that religion has a significantly positive impact on family relationships. But in a day and age when religion is being bashed on a regular basis by pop culture, finding validation of my family’s life-changing experience in a well-respected scientific publication makes for a--- well, nice Christmas gift.  &#10;&#10;Yes, Jesus – Christianity – is able to dramatically improve lives. And not always just our own. When Grandma Titi had the courage and conviction to stand up to Grandpa Lupe and embrace the faith, she ended up catalyzing a miraculous change not just in her own life, but in the life of her entire family … of the LACCC’s seminary … of my own life.  &#10;&#10;If Grandma Titi hadn’t invited those Elders to lay hands on my uncle Carlos. If Grandpa Lupe hadn’t become a minister. If the Armendariz family hadn’t joined the LACCC and met the Guillén family. Then my mother Betty wouldn’t have met my father Mariano …and I wouldn’t be here to write this column.  &#10;&#10;Ultimately, yes, Jesus is the reason I’m here. It’s the reason I celebrate his birthday – the only reason Christmas means anything to me. For me and the two billion others on the planet whose lives have been remade, it’s a time when we celebrate the incarnation of love, light, and life – the hope of a better day, a better life, a better world.  &#10;&#10;Merry Christmas!  	The reason I celebrate the holiday is this: Jesus’s ministry not only changed&#10;the world 2,000 years ago, it’s transforming lives to this very day.&#10;&#10;

Obama: Who's telling the truth?	  &#10;&#10;Time for my take now. Whose telling the truth? It’s not like Hollywood types like Sony are adversaries of President Obama but they\'re telling two different stories right now.  &#10;&#10;On Friday during this show, the president said he wished Sony execs had reached out to him to discuss the cyber-attack or vandalism, as he calls it, before they decided to pull the movie the interview from theaters. But just a few hours later ... the Sony CEO said in fact he had contacted Senior White House officials to discuss what the government though they should do.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;So, I ask you today, which one is it? Could it be that any senior white house advisor would not have relayed the message to the president that they\'d heard from Sony?  &#10;&#10;We were reporting all last week that the president was receiving daily updates and holding daily meetings about the North Korea cyber crisis. Seems implausible that could have slipped through the cracks.  &#10;&#10;So now the president says he\'ll weigh the options presented to him about what to do about North Korea. If trying to bring down an entire Hollywood company like Sony is only vandalism -- what would actually constitute an attack? Because rest assured -- unfortunately – I don’t think this attack won\'t be the last.  &#10;&#10;Gretchen Carlson currently serves as anchor of FOX News Channel\'s (FNC) The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson (weekdays 2-3PM/ET).

Sony, the studio that produced Seth Rogen’s $44 million comedy about the assassination North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un has dropped it.  &#10;&#10;Sony co-chairman Amy Pascal originally greenlighted this film. But as of today, she and her corporate bosses are the bitches of North Korea’s Dear Leader--the only guy in Hollywood with the power to red light a holiday blockbuster.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Kim didn’t even have to come to Hollywood to kill the film. An anonymous threat over the Internet was sufficient to shut it down. Just to make sure, he sent copies to Regal Entertainment, Cinemark, Carmike Cinemas and AMC—the companies who own most of the movie theaters in the U.S. and to the people who live near these theaters, any one of which could turn into World Trade Center II.  &#10;&#10;Before cancelling, the movie folks checked with Washington. If they thought their political contributions bought them some clout with Obama, they are now disabused of that.  &#10;&#10;“We are currently checking a range of options” says a National Security council spokesperson. The FBI let it be known that it is investigating. In Hollywood lingo, the issue is under development.  &#10;&#10;Some commentators are calling the shutdown of a major motion picture by foreign enemies an unprecedented act against American freedom of expression. But that is far from true, as Flemming Rose demonstrates in his recently published book, “The Tyranny of Silence."  &#10;&#10;In 2005, Rose, an editor at the Danish newspaper, Jyllands-Posten, published a series of caricatures lampooning the idea that Islam is a religion of peace. One drawing depicted Muhammad with a lit bomb on head. Rose’s purpose was to test whether Danish Muslim citizens were ready to accept the same kind of satirical criticism as their fellow citizens.  &#10;&#10;The answer was no. Islam forbids making images of Muhammad, no matter what is on his head. This is religious law, and since the courts in Copenhagen weren’t about to enforce it, Danish Imams launched an appeal to the faithful around the world.  &#10;&#10;The masses responded with pious alacrity. The Danish Embassy in Damascus was torched. The Danish consulate in Beirut was sacked. Mobs rioted from North Africa to Pakistan, attacking churches and individual Christians. Dozens, perhaps hundreds, died.  &#10;&#10;The American news media reported on this but, with few exceptions, blacked out the offending images. A New York Times editorial explained it as simple good manners, “a reasonable choice for news organizations that usually refrain from gratuitous assaults on religious symbols.” A spokeswoman for CNN said the network was censoring the images “out of respect for Islam” and to avoid “insulting and hurting certain groups.” The United States was then, as it is now, engaged in a war against Islamic extremism. There was a public debate about the nature of the enemy. There was nothing “gratuitous” about showing caricatures that had incited millions of Muslims and allowing the public to judge for itself.  &#10;&#10;On "Fox News Sunday," Chris Wallace displayed the cartoon of Muhammad and explained his network’s position: “We thought if we were going to tell the story about people rioting and burning down embassies, it’s part of the story to know what’s causing such outrage.” There were a few other exceptions to the ban (most notably ABC Nightly News, the Philadelphia Inquirer and the Austin Statesman American). But the vast majority of America’s senior news executives decided to forego the basic principle of their profession for an even more basic human impulse—self-preservation. They were very simply scared.  &#10;&#10;Nobody wanted to be held responsible for domestic acts of terror, bombings of their offices or attacks on their personnel. Least of all did they want to themselves become targets.  &#10;&#10;Only a year or so earlier, Dutch filmmaker Theo Van Gogh had been stabbed to death on an Amsterdam Street for making "Submission," a short drama about the violent oppression of women in the Muslim world. His colleague, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, was in hiding and subject to constant death threats. Novelist Salman Rushdie was still under a death warrant for insulting the prophet. So, for that matter, was Flemming Rose.  &#10;&#10;America’s enemies are connoisseurs of weakness, and they have discovered the rusty link where a lack of principle meets personal cowardice.  &#10;&#10;Why should North Korea venerate its Beloved Leader any less than Muslims venerate their Prophet? If you insult Kim Jong-un, will he not retaliate with an email that leaves the American government hapless and sends the power players of Hollywood heading for the Beverly Hills?  &#10;&#10;And who cares?  &#10;&#10;There are already voices seeking to convince us that this isn’t a big deal, that “The Interview” is just a comedy and there are better movies to see Christmas Day (check your local listings for time and North Korean permission). But these voices are wrong.  &#10;&#10;This is a very big deal, another station on the road to what Flemming Rose rightly calls “The Tyranny of Silence.” It is an important book. Don’t expect anyone to buy the movie rights.  	The news is out. “The Interview” will not be coming to a Cineplex near you on&#10;Christmas Day. Sony, the studio that produced Seth Rogen’s $44 million comedy&#10;about the assassination North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un has dropped it.&#10;&#10;

How the hell could Sony give in to the demands of terrorists? And make no mistake about it... The hackers who broke into their computer systems are just that: Terrorists.  &#10;&#10;Sony is a commercial enterprise and it has the prerogative to scrap the release of “The Interview.” But Sony is also the face of the United States in this heated relationship with North Korea, and the United States doesn’t negotiate with terrorists. Neither should Sony.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;It\'s a dark day for America when we cave over a simple, silly Seth Rogen comedy. It\'s embarrassing. It’s humiliating. It\'s exactly what these hackers wanted, and it creates an open season for anarchists.  &#10;&#10;I can\'t help but think of that brilliant scene in Steven Spielberg\'s much maligned but hilarious World War II comedy “1941," (1979) when Toshirô Mifune, playing a Japanese submarine commander, is under orders to destroy Hollywood from off the coast of Los Angeles. Mifune beams with pride after destroying the Ferris wheel at the Santa Monica pier. He thinks his mission is a success. He thinks he’s conquered America — just as North Korea probably thinks it has conquered us.  &#10;&#10;But in a way it has. Have at it, guys. Sony has just created a ridiculous, yet dangerous, precedent.  &#10;&#10;Watch the first episode of the brilliant British series "Black Mirror" (which debuted in 2011 and is currently streaming on Netflix) to see just how this situation played out and will continue to play out within our society. In the episode, a British princess is kidnapped, and the ransom demand calls for the prime minister to go on live television and have sex with a pig. The world stops; the masses are enthralled; the news and social media go to town with the juicy fodder. Some cheer the prime minister’s humiliation, some are disgusted, some are apathetic. But beneath it all, society is brought to its knees — and the Twitterverse welcomes it because it is a damn good spectacle. “Black Mirror” — the first episode, especially — was incredibly prescient.  &#10;&#10;Sony Pictures\' "The Interview" is just a movie. It may be just a stupid comedy, but it is still a work of expression — free expression! — something that separates us from them.  &#10;&#10;George Washington said, "If the freedom of speech is taken away, then dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep to the slaughter." For anyone to silence our creative voice is just wrong. Laughably wrong.  &#10;&#10;That is why Sony should not buckle to the pressure of these vile threats. I understand that people may have been afraid to go to the big chain theaters to see "The Interview," and I respect their desire to protect themselves and their families. Sincere props, though, to the Alamo Drafthouse in Dallas/Fort Worth for announcing they would show the equally controversial film “Team America: World Police” (2004) in place of “The Interview.” Thursday afternoon, Paramount announced that they would not publicly screen the movie,  &#10;&#10;Sony should seriously consider releasing the Seth Rogen-James Franco (and phenomenal Lizzy Caplan) comedy on-demand for a number of reasons:  &#10;&#10;One: Sony and all involved will get their incredible payday. Has any recent film received more free hype than "The Interview"?  &#10;&#10;Two: No theater will be harmed, even though theaters will lose potential revenue from the film.  &#10;&#10;Three: Most importantly, Sony — and we, the United States — will not give in to this ludicrous and obnoxious threat from an impotent and juvenile country.  &#10;&#10;This is America. We stand by our freedom. Even if it\'s a stupid comedy.  &#10;&#10;  	It's a dark day for America when Sony gives in to North Korea over a simple,&#10;silly Seth Rogen comedy. It's embarrassing. It’s humiliating. It's exactly&#10;what the hackers wanted, and it creates an open season for anarchists.&#10;&#10;

Our churches have compartmentalized faith and kept it from influencing our nation for far too long, just as most of America’s leaders compartmentalize their faith from their politics. Today, our nation has become a product of this sad reality.  &#10;&#10;We need to return to the conviction that a faith worth believing in is a faith worth dying for. Our faith cannot be checked at the door like a piece of luggage at an airport.  &#10;&#10;The Time is Now  &#10;&#10;The time is now for our nation to recognize that we cannot fix ourselves. The signs of our brokenness are glistening in our dark world. The blatant destruction of the family, the killing of unborn children, the continuing racial tension, the rebellion against authority, the ongoing reality of poverty, the rising threat of our security, the clear attacks against religious liberty and, of all things, the arrogance to believe the highest court in our land can rule on what the Bible says is genuine marriage testify to just how broken we really are.  &#10;&#10;Where Do We Go From Here?  &#10;&#10;1\. We need to repent.  &#10;&#10;Repentance occurs when we have a change of mind. This change of mind changes our behavior.  &#10;&#10;As a nation, we need to personally and collectively repent of our sins. We need to ask God for His free gift of forgiveness for the sins we have committed, resulting in change from that point forward.  &#10;&#10;2\. We need to return to God.  &#10;&#10;America is a nation that was built on a deep belief in God. A desire for religious liberty was the catalyst for the beginning of our nation. While we have gone through ups and downs in our history, God has been very merciful and gracious toward us.  &#10;&#10;It is time to return to God. It is time to stop making every issue about ourselves, posturing to ensure we get our way. God’s way is the only way. There is no other. Anything less than God’s way diminishes our happiness, our fulfillment and even our liberty.  &#10;&#10;3\. We need our churches to wake up.  &#10;&#10;Churches all over our nation need to wake up from the slumber we find ourselves in as a whole. We need pastors to return to their spiritual calling, be rekindled by the fire of God and declare the hope we have in the Lord. As a pastor goes, so goes the church.  &#10;&#10;As our churches go, so goes our nation. The evidence is overwhelming of just how broken we are as a nation. This is the greatest hour for our churches to rise up. Never more has America needed our churches to lead the way forward, serving and influencing our communities with compassion and hope.  &#10;&#10;4\. We need a spiritual awakening.  &#10;&#10;In our history, there have been seasons of spiritual awakening that have influenced the spiritual state of our nation dramatically. Lives were changed and subcultures became different. Spiritual awakening is our greatest need in America today.  &#10;&#10;There are many who have probably never even thought about this need. Others may feel we have gone too far. But I want to assure you: God can do more in a moment than we can ever do in a lifetime.  &#10;&#10;Wherever you are in life, would you just stop for one moment and pray something like this: “God, would you please bring spiritual awakening to America? It is our greatest need.”?  &#10;&#10;America’s greatest need is the next great move of God. This is our hope.  	Who is addressing the spiritual state of our nation? Are we really trusting&#10;only in governmental powers and processes to heal our land?&#10;&#10;

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)  &#10;&#10;Pundits agonize over President Obama’s resistance to calling Islamist terror “Islamist terror.” How can he not see the obvious? How can he ignore the overwhelming and ever-increasing evidence? How can he insist that his subordinates continue their buffoonish insistence that Islamist terror has nothing to do with Islam and that they—secularized Christians and non- observant Jews—know Islam’s character better than Muslims themselves?  &#10;&#10;It’s easy. President Obama and his commissars fit the longstanding pattern of behavior (insistence, denial, castigation) that the hard left has embraced for generations. In the mid-20th century, leftists, bereft of God and desperate for a new faith, insisted for decade after decade that Comrade Stalin was a paragon of political virtues and that the Soviet Union was Utopia. All reports of purges, terror, man-made famines and the Gulag were fabrications of capitalists and their servants.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Even after Premier Khrushchev revealed Stalin’s crimes to the world, hardcore leftists excused or ignored the truth, insisting still that Red terror wasn’t terror and that Communism was a movement (religion?) of peace and progress, that humankind’s hope still waited in the east. Only the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet collapse briefly sobered a few on the extreme left—the milieu in which our president spent his youth and pre-presidency adulthood.  &#10;&#10;But leftists need a utopia, a fantasy heaven on earth, to comfort them and to give their lives purpose. Robbed of the Soviet dream, the forlorn left was in need of a new redeemer.  &#10;&#10;Welcome, Comrade Usama! The left—and young Barack Obama -- already saw Islam as an oppressed religion, the noble faith of the wretched of the earth, while casting Christianity and Judaism in the role once occupied by capitalist imperialists: that of oppressors. Bin Laden gave the left a new torch to carry. While it remained necessary to condemn terrorism in public, the left simultaneously justified it in a globalized version of the Marxist construct of a class struggle.  &#10;&#10;Really, didn’t American deserve 9/11?  &#10;&#10;Islamism fit the left like a tailored glove. Just as Western Reds didn’t need to endure life in the Soviet Union (“Pass the foie gras, Comrade!”), so today’s leftwing cadres need not actually live in the Middle East or North Africa. From the comfort of Cambridge or the splendor of California’s coast, they can rationalize radical Islam, a creed that would, if imported here, exterminate them as surely as Comrade Stalin would have purged the old American left.  &#10;&#10;The staff of Charlie Hebdo? Stalin would have killed those pranksters, too. The only difference is that “Uncle Joe” would have gotten them all.  &#10;&#10;When you take the long view, it’s disheartening (to put it mildly) that the Western left simply cannot live without dreaming of an impossible utopia to be imposed by one ideology or another on the rest of us. Radical Islam? It’s a “religion of peace.” Just as Soviet Communism was an ideology of peace, justice and brotherhood.  &#10;&#10;So President Obama’s just playing by the time-honored rules, substituting Muhammad for Josef Stalin or Mao: Never criticize the Party. Ignore the facts. If the facts can’t be ignored, deny or twist them. No matter what, stick to the script (let them laugh for now, they’ll see soon enough...). And anyone who strays one inch must be neutralized, whether as a Trotskyist yesteryear or slandered as an Islamophobe today.  &#10;&#10;The left’s existential bleakness and its resultant need to embrace horrid schemes for man-made heavens on earth form a peerless argument for humankind’s need for religion. In the absence of belief there is only a desert of the soul. And Red terror gives way to Islamist terror. The Communist International cedes pride of place to the global caliphate. Comrade Stalin fades into Comrade Muhammad.  &#10;&#10;Truth is malleable. Facts are nuisances to be exterminated, along with troublesome people. Middle-class notions of freedom must be shouted down. The rule of the intellectuals must be imposed. Never, ever criticize the cause. Deny everything. Never forget that Islam’s a religion of peace.  &#10;&#10;The future is ours, Comrades.  	President Obama and his commissars fit the longstanding pattern of behavior&#10;(insistence, denial, castigation) that the hard left has embraced for&#10;generations.&#10;&#10;
246-starwarsstereotypesnotforce	aljazeera	Mon, 01 Dec 2014 08:56:40 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/star-wars-stereotypes-not-force-201412172145780714.html	Alistair Crighton	Star Wars stereotypes: Not a force for good	Earlier Star Wars movies are noted for dramatic Middle East locations, but they contained some rather unpleasant regional cliches. With Abu Dhabi locations taking centre stage in the latest trailer, can we expect fairer treatment for the region?  &#10;&#10;Unless you were stuck out in the far reaches of the solar system, you'll have noticed that the biggest cinema event of 2014 was released over the Thanksgiving weekend.  &#10;&#10;What's surprising is that it was just one and a half minutes long. The buzz on the internet surrounding the new Star Wars trailer is showing that the franchise is assuredly a force to outmatch cat videos or even Kim Kardashian.  &#10;&#10;It's almost four decades since George Lucas redefined blockbuster cinema with the original Star Wars - and despite his own attempts to undermine his legacy with a trio of poorly conceived prequels - the juggernaut shows no sign of slowing down. Revitalised under the helm of JJ Abrams (Lost, the Star Trek reboots) and in the hands of Disney, the new movie is building its hype very early indeed. The teaser trailer hit our screens a full year before the movie itself is scheduled to be released.  &#10;&#10;This triggered everything from frame by frame breakdowns by respectable newspapers, to a deluge of parodies (the Lego version is a favourite; while the George Lucas version will appeal to geeks). Even the Middle East's favourite home-grown parody site, the Pan Arabia Enquirer, got in the action, deftly skewering the Facebook updates and tweets from UAE residents adamant that the sand dunes of Abu Dhabi commanded the starring role in the new teaser.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;So heaven knows what they'd make of an entire column on the subject. Because the thing is, the franchise has always had a long, if not entirely comfortable, relationship with the Middle East.  &#10;&#10;In the first movie, scenes taking place on the desert world, Tatooine, were famously shot in Tunisia; the fictional planet is even named after the Tunisian city of Tatouine as homage. By all accounts, the shoot there was difficult, with unseasonal rainstorms slowing production and sandstorms blitzing the complicated props.  &#10;&#10;Still that didn't stop the director from returning in 1997 to film scenes from the first prequel there; the props and sets left behind from both shoots remain a tourist draw to this day.  &#10;&#10;So far, so good; more problematic, though, is Lucas' heavy-handed stereotyping. The first movie brought us the Sand People; violent and savage desert dwellers who bear more than a passing resemblance to the Bedouin. (A later instalment even has them capturing the white mother of the hero/antihero, prompting violent retribution and a clear understanding among viewers that Lucas' racial sensibilities haven't shifted much from the Cowboys and Indian serials he grew up watching.)  &#10;&#10;Not much better were the scavenging, hustling Jawas, piloting a giant slave ship for robots around the dunes; or the Mos Eisley Cantina, a bar drawn straight from the malaria-fevered imaginations of an old colonial soak returned from some mythical Kasbah in the mystical Orient.  &#10;&#10;Far more troubling, though, was the repulsive Watto from the disappointing prequel, "The Phantom Menace". A slave-owning, money-obsessed trader, Watto has the singular honour of being roundly criticised as both an anti-Arab and an anti-Jewish stereotype. Patricia J Williams, writing in the The Nation said simply that the character was "more comprehensively anti-Semitic - both anti- Arab and anti-Jew".  &#10;&#10;And the Semites got off lightly - other characters in the movie managed to offend the entire Caribbean (Jar Jar Binks, the most unpopular character in cinematic history), and pretty much everyone in Asia (the sneaky "oriental" types who triggered some sort of trade war and kicked off the whole mess in the first place - please don't make me watch it again to get their names.)  &#10;&#10;So, should there be mixed feelings in this part of the world that the trailer opens with a shot of the Empty Quarter, and continues with a very opening-of- Lawrence of Arabia shot of a young woman on a speeder bike?  &#10;&#10;Actually, no. Abu Dhabi can be confident that, even if Watto returns, commanding an entire army of Sand People against our noble heroes, (just wait for Lucas' extended version for that scene) the experience will still be net positive in terms of bringing in visitors and establishing itself further as a major film destination.  &#10;&#10;Dangerous stereotypes  &#10;&#10;Besides, narratives are outside the control of a host country, even when they choose not to host. The emirate washed its hands of one Hollywood venture, and still managed to get tarred with a very unpleasant brush. Abu Dhabi very sensibly blocked the filming of the woeful "Sex in the City 2" on its territory, forcing the film-makers to use Morocco instead, while still setting the action in "Abu Dhabi" and thus indelibly linking the emirate to an abysmal film memorably panned by the BBC's Mark Kermode as "consumerist pornography" and "an orgy of dripping wealth that made me want to be sick".  &#10;&#10;Of course, there will always be the argument that Star Wars is simply entertainment, and it doesn't do any favours to delve too deep into subplots and symbolism from what is essentially a kids' movie. But it's stereotypes in mass market entertainment - and particularly in movies aimed at children - that can be most dangerous. Disney itself has long kept its 1946 feature "Song of the South" practically under lock and key lest its dated, racist version of post-slavery American south influence today's children.  &#10;&#10;Still, George Lucas' fable happened a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, and we can hope that JJ Abram's take on the mythology will be a little more progressive in its portrayal of the fictionalised desert world.  &#10;&#10;After all, it's a saga set in a desert, years after popular revolts overthrow a despotic regime, only for dark forces to emerge and fill the political vacuum. What could be more far-fetched than that?  	After popular revolts oust a despotic regime, dark forces emerge to fill the&#10;political vacuum - how far-fetched is that?&#10;&#10;
247-stateunionadviceforjoniernst	foxnews	2015-01-20T17:03:43Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/01/20/state-union-advice-for-joni-ernst/	Cal Thomas	State of the Union: Advice for Joni Ernst	Here’s a suggestion for Joni Ernst, the new Republican senator from Iowa, who will deliver the GOP response to the State of the Union address Tuesday night. Get a chorus together and open with this old Sammy Cahn-Jule Styne number: “It seems to me I’ve heard that song before; it’s from an old familiar score, I know it well, that melody.”  &#10;&#10;Advance leaks of the president’s address indicate he will call for higher taxes on the wealthy and successful in order to pay for programs for the poor and middle class. This is boilerplate Democratic wealth redistribution we’ve heard since New Deal days, which appeals more to emotions than it does to principles with a long history of success.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Since the advent of modern “anti-poverty” programs 50 years ago, according to an analysis by The Heritage Foundation, “U.S. taxpayers have spent over $22 trillion on anti-poverty programs.” And yet the poverty rate remains essentially unchanged. One might conclude then that if you’ve spent 50 years and $22 trillion trying without success to fix something, perhaps you’re doing it wrong and should try a different approach.  &#10;&#10;If the goal is more successful people who can take care of themselves, incentives must be put in place to encourage people to make right decisions.  &#10;&#10;First on any anti-poverty help-the-middle-class list must be a stable family life. A two-parent home where adults love and are committed to each other and in which their children feel loved creates a climate in which moral and economic values like hard work, self-control, personal responsibility and accountability flourish.  &#10;&#10;To help achieve this, parents must be educated and they must have jobs. Government can make this easier by reforming the tax code to remove the “marriage penalty,” which in too many instances charges higher taxes to married couples than to singles, and increasing the exemption deductible for children, which might make it possible for one parent to stay home with young children; allow college tuition to be deductible to incentivize more people to obtain a college education and ease their debt upon graduation.  &#10;&#10;Better yet, scrap the tax code entirely and replace it with a flat tax or consumption tax that allows people to save, invest and spend more of the money they earn.  &#10;&#10;Economically, there must be a change in attitude from working to pay bills, to working to build wealth. Bills, like the poor, we will always have with us, but in building wealth one moves toward independence and personal satisfaction that pays dividends in liberty and personal choice.  &#10;&#10;Government should also make it easier for people to move in pursuit of new opportunities. My late grandfather worked for the B and O Railroad for 50 years. He retired with a pension, a gold-plated watch and a lifetime train pass. Those days are long gone. People need to be ready to move to places in pursuit of opportunities that can bring economic and career growth. Earning more produces more in taxable income and more income means more tax money for federal and state treasuries. My wife and I have moved eight times (so far) and each move provided new opportunities, more experience and eventually higher incomes.  &#10;&#10;Here’s another suggestion for Sen. Ernst and the new Republican Congress. Let the Democrats focus on misery, poverty and failure. You promote hope, opportunity and achievement. Begin featuring people with stories to tell of how they overcame difficult circumstances — from poverty, welfare, addiction, single motherhood, and so on — and are now independent, strong and if not prosperous, then at least free of their addiction to government.  &#10;&#10;Leaders should inspire others to follow examples of people who have succeeded in life. Instead, the Democrats’ mantra has been that the poor and middle class can’t succeed without government help. If that were true, the money spent on programs aimed at the poor and middle class would have succeeded by now.  &#10;&#10;It’s long past time for a new direction and for a new “song” with different words. In the month we observe the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr., how about “We HAVE overcome”?  	Here’s a suggestion for Joni Ernst, the new Republican senator from Iowa, who&#10;will deliver the GOP response to the State of the Union address Tuesday night.&#10;Get a chorus together and open with this old Sammy Cahn-Jule Styne number: “It&#10;seems to me I’ve heard that song before; it’s from an old familiar score, I&#10;know it well, that melody.”&#10;&#10;

Gay actors have been coming out left, right and centre. Hollywood’s no longer hung up on homosexuality, right?  &#10;&#10;Well, despite all that’s been achieved, it’s seems it’s still possible for gay themes to make the men in suits nervous. Reports suggest that the covers of US DVDs of the movie Pride – yes, that’s Pride, a story about fighting for respect, without compromise or shame – have been straightwashed. A banner proclaiming “lesbians and gays support the miners” has been airbrushed out of the picture on the back cover, and the queer agitators are now simply “a group of London-based activists” in the blurb. Director Matthew Warchus says he “understands” the decision.  &#10;&#10;These changes, albeit a marketing, not a film-making decision, nevertheless stand in a time-honoured industry tradition of downplaying homosexuality. For years, film-makers in America were trapped by the motion picture production code, which banned “any inference of sex perversion”. As the brilliant 1995 documentary The Celluloid Closet sets out, screenwriters and directors snuck in gay themes where they could, with Gore Vidal memorably writing Ben Hur and Messala as though they were lovers turned rivals (Charlton Heston had no idea). But in general, gay storylines were box office poison.  &#10;&#10;Even after the code ceased to be enforced, film-makers were very tentative – and open homosexuality could never be anything other than arthouse niche (though that in itself encompassed some brilliant movies, like Bill Sherwood’s Parting Glances). This pink-tinted glass ceiling was arguably broken by Philadelphia, a belated nod to the Aids crisis. But then that wasn’t a rounded story of gay life, but a reason to feel sorry for a benighted minority. And there was grief, but no sex.  &#10;&#10;You would hope we had moved on. But the Pride story brings into sharp relief the sense that, as with society at large, though audiences may be broadly OK with being gay, it’s as well not to shove it in people’s faces. To take some fairly recent examples: the 2001 John Nash biopic, A Beautiful Mind, ignores the mathematician’s gay affairs. In 2004, the makers of Troy chose not to explore the homoerotic possibilities of the relationship between Achilles and Patroculus, one subject to much speculation through the ages, making them cousins instead. More recently, The Imitation Game has been accused of playing down Alan Turing’s sexuality. And in many parts of the world, straight-washing is practically mandated – as the Russian makers of a film about Tschaikovsky have found.  &#10;&#10;Having said all that, there’s also an age-old political conundrum that I think Warchus’s quotes capture well. He wants his work “to find a mainstream audience [and] broaden people’s minds”. If Pride reaches deep into the square states – subtly influencing parents, siblings, friends to be more accepting – isn’t that a good thing? It reminds me of the difference in tactics between Outrage – fans of direct action against, for example, bishops – and Stonewall, keener to make quiet political alliances in the service of long-term change.  &#10;&#10;I find it utterly bizarre that a movie called “Pride” is being pushed back into the closet in 2015. But at the same time, it would be wrong to pretend that there’s an easy answer to Warchus’s dilemma.  	David Shariatmadari: The US cover left out references to gay men and lesbians. It’s the latest in a long tradition of playing down homosexuality on screen

Kennedy High School in Paterson, N.J., was caught on video throwing his 62-year-old teacher to the ground and wrestling with him in order to retrieve his cellphone, which the teacher had confiscated. Teachers at the school allow cellphones to be used for educational purposes in the classroom, but they may take them and hold them until the end of class if a student appears to be using his phone for any other purpose.  &#10;&#10;Granted, the boy may have demonstrated problems controlling his impulses in other settings, too, but the video of his attack has resulted in national attention. And that’s because it isn’t the first dramatic example of how attached to our phones we have become.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Last year, a Houston woman was shot by a mugger when she refused to hand over her cellphone. She survived, and she later asserted that she had done the right thing.  &#10;&#10;In 2013, a 22-year-old man was killed by a train when he tried to retrieve the cellphone he had dropped on the tracks.  &#10;&#10;Without giving a great deal of thought to the psychological implications, our species has deployed mobile technology very quickly, in a very widespread manner. One reason is that the marketplace embraced smartphones in an astounding way — as if our phones and their apps are a lock-and-key fit with our psyches. According to one source, there are 7 billion mobile devices on earth, one for almost each person.  &#10;&#10;What is “in” our cellphones that would lead people to attack others or risk death to keep them? I would argue that the phones absorb and record our thoughts and intentions so dramatically that we become unconsciously convinced they are “parts of us.” Why else would so many people hesitate even to leave a room without taking their cellphones with them? Why would they interrupt meetings and family time to check them? Why would young people be opting to spend their money on newer, faster ones, instead of on clothing?  &#10;&#10;Why would there be so much interest in personalizing the sounds they make, the apps they hold and the cases that hold them?  &#10;&#10;I contend we have already crossed the Rubicon, almost irrevocably incorporating technology into our psyches in a way that makes us part flesh and blood, part hardware. The fact that the hardware is outside our bodies (for now) does not mean the integration has not occurred. We are psychologically magnetized to our devices. That’s why some people will fight for them, and even die for them.  &#10;&#10;The selfie has become so ubiquitous that it no longer seems bizarre to see someone smiling into a cellphone or sticking out her tongue or making a sad face — acting — and then snapping a photo. And these images are then sent not only to her supposed “friends,” who may number in the hundreds, but also to her unconscious mind — reinforcing the idea that she is what her cellphone records her to be. Take away the cellphone and, in some measure, she believes she disappears. She feels she dies a little bit, or more than a little bit, psychologically.  &#10;&#10;The business of selling “selfie sticks” — telescoping rods that hold a cellphone far enough away to facilitate a really good shot — is robust enough to make many retailers place large kiosks of them near the checkout register. Cellphones, you might say, are growing arms. Ours apparently aren’t long enough.  &#10;&#10;This is just the beginning. Cellphones will soon be able to determine whether you are looking at the content on their screens, rather than looking away. They will demand attention. The extent to which we own them versus them owning us will be increasingly in doubt.  &#10;&#10;Make no mistake: While technology can be good when harnessed for the good (raising money for charity occurs to me), there will be hell to pay for giving so little thought to the downside. That downside likely includes an epidemic of narcissism in young people, increased rates of anxiety and dramatically decreased feelings of autonomy. Because to the extent that one’s self-image is outsourced to a mobile device, it is no more deeply rooted than that.  &#10;&#10;Bill Hemmer and Martha MacCallum bring you the news that matters to you!

Kennedy High School was&#10;caught on video throwing his 62-year-old teacher to the ground and wrestling&#10;with him, in order to retrieve his cell phone, which the teacher had&#10;confiscated.&#10;&#10;

Though he described the budget presented to parliament as "cautious" and "tight", military spending is to rise by 33.5 percent, far above the six percent increase in the general budget.  &#10;&#10;This will likely result in a greater military footprint in the region, particularly in Syria and Iraq, where Iranian troops are directly involved in combat, training, logistics and intelligence-gathering (Tehran this week expanded its operations in Iraq to include air strikes). It is also likely meant as a show of strength and defiance against Iran's regional rivals.  &#10;&#10;However, it is doubtful that Tehran can economically sustain its existing regional military commitments, let alone expand them. Crippling sanctions and a massive drop in oil prices mean a much larger military budget will put further strain on the economy, which has reportedly shrunk by 8.6 percent over the past two fiscal years.  &#10;&#10;Furthermore, the new budget might not be "cautious" enough. While it is based on oil being $70 per barrel, the price has fallen to under $70, with predictions that it will hover around $65 for the next several months, and perhaps slump even further. This is worrying news for the government, whose revenues are largely dependent on oil.  &#10;&#10;In addition, western sanctions have caused Iran's oil exports to plummet compared with a few years ago. Last year, the oil minister said the fall in exports was costing the country up to $8bn each month. Iran reportedly lost some $26bn in oil revenue in 2012. Sanctions and falling oil revenues have hurt the value of Iran's currency, and caused inflation to rise considerably.  &#10;&#10;There has been an easing of sanctions in light of negotiations over Iran's nuclear programme, but it is limited. Given that the talks have been extended by several months, the bulk of the sanctions will remain in place at least until then, with no indication as yet that a deal is within reach. Sanctions could be reinstated or increased if the talks fail.  &#10;&#10;All this amounts to an economy that cannot keep up with Iran's regional ambitions. The hike in military spending may arouse domestic anger if it is seen by Iranians as spurred by foreign ventures, which is already a cause of increasing frustration, particularly with regard to propping up the Syrian regime.  &#10;&#10;While Tehran is secretive about the extent of its military and financial assistance to its regional allies, there is a consensus that it has been a considerable economic drain, not least because of the long-term nature of these commitments.  &#10;&#10;Tehran's direct military involvement in Iraq is viewed by many Iranians as necessary to stop the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) from reaching its borders. However, there are reports of growing unease, among the public and within government, about the accumulating burden of propping up Bashar al-Assad in Syria, with no end in sight to a conflict that is entering its fourth year.  &#10;&#10;Given the current economic climate, it may be harder for Iran and Russia - which is also hurting under western sanctions and low oil prices - to sustain the war of attrition in Syria than for Assad's opponents. While the latter are also affected by falling oil prices, they are not under sanctions.  &#10;&#10;Furthermore, according to the International Monetary Fund, Iran and Russia need a much higher oil price to balance their budgets than Arab Gulf states, key backers of Syrian rebels. Given this, and Arab Gulf states' large cash reserves and funds, they can absorb low oil prices for longer. Saudi Arabia has relatively low production costs, and the US is enjoying a boom in shale oil. Iran's oil revenue reserve fund, on the other hand, has reportedly been drained.  &#10;&#10;Government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht accused "some so-called Islamic countries in the region" of "serving the interests of America and [other] arrogant powers in trying to squeeze the Islamic Republic".  &#10;&#10;Rouhani has spoken of a "political conspiracy by certain countries". Other Iranian officials have specifically pointed the finger at Saudi Arabia.  &#10;&#10;Regional political calculations may have been behind the decision by Riyadh and its Arab Gulf neighbours to stop the recent OPEC meeting from deciding to cut oil output to shore up prices. The intention may be to curb Iran's regional power, and to weaken its negotiating position over its nuclear programme, over which the Gulf Cooperation Council has been very vocal in its concerns.  &#10;&#10;However, other theories unrelated to Iran have been offered by analysts, and Gulf officials have spoken only of market forces rather than political considerations. In any case, the result is that for the foreseeable future, it will be increasingly costly for Tehran to maintain and extend its regional influence.  &#10;&#10;Its new budget defies this reality, but Iranians cannot, and should not, endure indefinite economic hardship. They are less likely to tolerate such a situation if their sacrifices at home are paying for long-term military ventures abroad from which they see little tangible benefit.  	There is growing unease in Iran over the accumulated financial burden of&#10;Tehran's regional military commitments.&#10;&#10;
251-sydneyhostagecrisisaustraliaha	foxnews	2014-12-15T15:22:11Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/12/15/sydney-hostage-crisis-australia-has-lost-its-innocence/	Nick Adams	Sydney Hostage Crisis: Australia has lost its innocence	  &#10;&#10;Australia is known as the “lucky country.”  &#10;&#10;It was a phrase first coined in 1964 by social critic Donald Horne, and has come to represent the visceral feelings of both Australians, and visitors to the nation.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;It is seen as a reflection of a high standard of living, and a geographical insulation from the bad actors of the world theater.  &#10;&#10;But ten days out from Christmas, Australia has lost its innocence.  &#10;&#10;On a day of brilliant blue skies, the terrorism of the post-9/11 world finally arrived on Australian soil, taking hold of city streets.  &#10;&#10;A man wielding a gun and an Islamic flag took customers and staff hostage at a cafe in central Sydney.  &#10;&#10;As a native of Sydney, home for the holidays, safe and sound but shaken and furious, December 15 is a day that will forever be seared into my mind. I’ve been to the Lindt Café; in fact, I once worked across the street from it. Emotions have run high here all day -- from fear to anger to a desire for vengeance. I never expected this in Sydney.  &#10;&#10;The profoundly shocking standoff with all its disruptions to city life has struck fear in Sydneysiders, unaccustomed to these types of events.  &#10;&#10;The mood in Sydney is one of fear and uncertainty.  &#10;&#10;Until now, Australian authorities have been flawless in preventing terror attacks on Australian soil. They have been aggressive in their pursuit of intelligence and would-be terrorists, foiling plot after plot.  &#10;&#10;September saw the biggest anti-terrorism operation in Australia’s history, involving up to 800 police in coordinated raids, sparked by intelligence reports that Islamic State supporters were planning to seize a random member of the public and behead them live on camera.  &#10;&#10;Yet, it was inevitable that one would finally slip through the cracks, and Monday Sydney joined the ranks of cities such as New York, London and Madrid as the latest victim of what appears to be Islamic terrorism.  &#10;&#10;Monday’s distressing events have renewed Australians’ concerns about Islamist objectives, and a growing Islamic presence in the country.  &#10;&#10;Some Australians recognize that this likely terrorist attack is a result of the poor immigration decisions of Australian governments, both conservative and liberal, over the last four decades.  &#10;&#10;A lack of liberty, an abandonment of reason, the imposition of Sharia on Muslims and non-Muslims, as well as the treatment of women are just some of the serious moral problems within the Muslim world. Islamist views are incompatible with the liberty enjoyed by Australians and Americans.  &#10;&#10;Interestingly, Monday’s events have also prompted Australians to revisit their gun laws.  &#10;&#10;With Islamic supremacism a mainstream interpretation of Islam, deeply rooted in Islamic scripture and endorsed by many of Islam’s most influential scholars, Australians are beginning to understand the nature of the Islamic threat, and studying their own weaknesses in its wake.  &#10;&#10;The United Kingdom has had two beheadings of members of the public in the last two years, with neither police nor civilians able to prevent it. It also has prohibitive gun laws.  &#10;&#10;Australians are looking to America, and not the UK for guidance.  &#10;&#10;With this sort of threat, the normal calculus of a civilized society with a small, armed (or unarmed) police force upon which the citizens are forced to rely, no longer adds up.  &#10;&#10;It is unsurprising that home-grown terrorism is most rampant in nations with strict gun control. It is a reality that Australia’s powerful anti-gun lobby seems to wish to ignore.  &#10;&#10;It is times like these that Americans should be thankful for their Second Amendment, and crush any effort or force seeking to weaken or remove it.  &#10;&#10;Right now, they are the envy of a growing number of Australians that wish they were armed.  &#10;&#10;Australia will never be the same again. Sydney just lost a little of its shine.  	Ten days out from Christmas, Australia has lost its innocence.&#10;&#10;
252-theparisunitymarchshowswemustp	guardian	2015-01-12T01:21:49Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/12/the-paris-unity-march-shows-we-must-protect-freedom-of-expression-not-curtail-it-further	Julie Posetti	The Paris unity march shows we must protect freedom of expression, not curtail it further	I was just one Australian face in a human sea of more than one and half million Parisians yesterday. I was trying to comprehend what I was a part of when the placard thrust in front of my eyes made it clear: “La liberte d’expression n’a pas de religion” – freedom of expression has no religion. This was a rally to defend the essential global human right to free expression. A right that should not be bound by religious, cultural or political strictures.  &#10;&#10;We were marching to remember the victims of the Charlie Hebdo newsroom massacre and the Kosher grocery store siege. We were marching in sympathy with those in mourning who joined us. We were marching in defiance, determined to rise above the fear and chaos the terrorists inflicted on our city. But, overwhelmingly, we marched to defend our right to freely express our views.  &#10;&#10;The main march stretched three kilometres between Place de la Republique and Place de la Nation, tracking down Boulevard Voltaire. When I cried “Je suis Charlie, nous somme Charlie!”, it was in the spirit of the French philosopher Voltaire’s revolutionary words: “I do not agree with what you have to say, but I’ll defend to the death your right to say it.”  &#10;&#10;The props of the rally – giant pencils supporting the French flag, a flood of demonstrators holding pens aloft and bibs emblazoned with the faces of the massacred Charlie Hebdo staff – told the story.  &#10;&#10;Paris has been my home for a year. I am a research fellow with the World Editors Forum and the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers which is based in the city. It’s a long way from the University of Wollongong in Australia, where I am on staff as a journalism academic.  &#10;&#10;But the principle of freedom of expression we were marching to defend binds journalists, writers and artists, and by extension all citizens, globally. It transcends national borders, distance, culture, language, class and religion.  &#10;&#10;That’s why, as we marched, we saw Paris residents hanging models of pencils and banners carrying free speech slogans from their balconies. And it’s why we paused to listen while a little African girl bellowed “Je suis Charlie!” from a third story window at her mother’s side.  &#10;&#10;We were a calm sea of over 1.5 million people pouring through the grand boulevards of central Paris. Led by the families of those killed and over 40 world leaders who walked with linked arms, it was a significant moment in history, a moment triggered by outrage at the act of terrorists who massacred journalists and cartoonists in the middle of a weekly editorial meeting and ordinary citizens doing their shopping. It was also a moment fuelled by a collective determination to display unity and defiance in the face of terror and fear.  &#10;&#10;The attack on Charlie Hebdo and the climate of fear and anxiety it created are, sadly, regular occurrences in countries such as Iraq, Syria, Pakistan and Mexico, where journalists are frequent targets. The western media too often turns a blind eye to the murder of journalists elsewhere.  &#10;&#10;The Paris unity march represents a watershed moment in the struggle to protect journalists and defend freedom of expression globally. Kalashnikov-wielding terrorists took the fight into the heart of a newsroom in one of western Europe’s biggest cities. If that doesn’t wake up complacent democracies to the need to vigorously defend the right to report, nothing will.  &#10;&#10;Once the news cycle moves on from Paris and the cries of “Je suis Charlie” fade, we must harness the levels of public support and political will to enact significant and lasting change globally.  &#10;&#10;We must be on guard against the already audible attempts to justify a further curtailment of media and internet freedoms in the interests of national security in the aftermath of the Paris terror attacks. The threats posed to investigative journalism by mass surveillance, data retention and the criminalisation of reporting certain information under anti-terrorism legislation are already significant. Especially in Australia.  &#10;&#10;It would be an enormous tragedy if the lasting legacy of the Charlie Hebdo massacre was ultimately a further undermining of privacy and freedom of expression rights. Let us honour the victims and survivors of the Paris terrorist attacks by finding a sustainable balance between the need for anti- terrorism measures against our collective human right to freely express our views.  &#10;&#10;As the murdered editor-in-chief of Charlie Hebdo, Stephane Charbonnier, told Le Monde in 2011: “I’d rather die standing than live on my knees.”  	There are already calls for further restrictions on internet and media freedoms following the Charlie Hebdo massacre. It would be a tragedy if that were the legacy of those who died protecting their right…
253-therenodebateabouttorture	aljazeera	Wed, 31 Dec 2014 12:27:27 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/there-no-debate-about-torture-2014123012163988743.html	Jonathan Hafetz	There is no debate about torture	The Senate Intelligence Committee's scathing torture report not only described the brutality of the CIA's interrogation methods, but also demonstrated their ineffectiveness. Led by ex-Vice President Dick Cheney, former Bush administration officials have rushed to the airwaves to defend the CIA.  &#10;&#10;"I would do it again in a minute," Cheney said on NBC's Meet the Press, claiming that Enhanced Interrogation Techniques (EITs) produced "actionable intelligence that kept us safe from attacks".  &#10;&#10;Cheney & Co may not win the debate, but they have succeeded in muddying the waters. That is unfortunate because, beneath their bombastic caricatures of the torture programme, there's more agreement than first appears among people who actually count.  &#10;&#10;Aside from former officials trying to save their reputations, it isn't one camp saying torture didn't "work" and one saying it did. Rather, it's one camp saying it didn't, and the other saying "we have no idea but did it anyway".  &#10;&#10;On several key points, the CIA is closer in substance to the Senate report than to its loudest defenders.  &#10;&#10;'Unprepared' for torture  &#10;&#10;The Senate report found that the CIA was "unprepared" to operate a detention and interrogation system. The Agency's written response to the report says; "We fully agree" - the CIA had "no cadre of trained and experienced interrogators, little experience handling and moving prisoners, and no core competency in prison management. [...] The Agency had too few analysts and linguists with the expertise required to support [a detention] programme".  &#10;&#10;In other words, there is no dispute that the programme was started and run on the fly.  &#10;&#10;A critical finding of the Senate report was that torturing detainees did not yield otherwise unobtainable actionable intelligence. CIA director, John O Brennan, admitted that the agency "has not concluded that it was the use of EITs that allowed us to obtain useful information from detainees".  &#10;&#10;So while the CIA still maintains that it gained valuable intelligence from detainees, it is not saying the abusive methods produced it.  &#10;&#10;The Senate report also describes how the CIA sought out two psychiatrists, James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen, to construct the torture programme instead of actual experienced interrogators, on the assumption that long-established humane and lawful interrogation methods wouldn't work.  &#10;&#10;In its response, the CIA acknowledged that it had to look beyond the agency to find experts on "non-standard means of interrogation" since it was not an area of expertise that CIA officers or the US government possessed. The CIA called Mitchell and Jessen's background "so unique" that the agency "would have been derelict had [it] not sought them out when it became clear that CIA would be heading into the uncharted territory of the programme".  &#10;&#10;In other words, the torture programme was so out of whack with what professional interrogators do that the CIA had to go outside the US government to find people to do it.  &#10;&#10;There still are important areas of disagreement between the Senate report and the CIA. The CIA is too protective of its own to acknowledge the full import of its descent into torture or to disavow the programme entirely. But the agency - unlike its loudest defenders - is not endorsing torture as a means of gaining intelligence or keeping the country safe.  &#10;&#10;To be sure, basing the case against torture on its total ineffectiveness is a risky proposition. Torture produces a lot of information and while victims frequently make things up to ease their suffering, they may also on occasion say things of some value. That's why it is important to remember that torture is illegal under any circumstances regardless of its utility.  &#10;&#10;But in a democracy, the strength of legal norms depends partly on their acceptance by the public. So while the public shouldn't have to be persuaded that barbaric methods fail to make them safer, doing so reinforces their illegality.  &#10;&#10;The flurry of media appearances by Cheney and other torture defenders has created a false sense that there is a genuine divide over whether torture "works". But neither the CIA nor professional interrogators actually say that. So while we can continue to debate other aspects of the CIA programme, including whether those responsible should be sanctioned, let's stop pretending that there are two legitimate sides to this particular story.  	Nobody who matters actually says it works.&#10;&#10;

Everywhere they have chosen the garbage disposal unit.” The Situationists’ vision of the future was not, as I’m sure you’ve guessed, an optimistic one, but it’s nice to see that their spirit is alive and well on the London underground.  &#10;&#10;“How can one even begin to speak of dignity in labour when one secretly feels that one’s job should not exist?” a poster asks, as part of a campaign called #bullshitjobs devised by the anarchist magazine Strike! Another poster reads: “The moral and spiritual damage that comes from the situation is profound. It is a scar on our collective soul. Virtually no one talks about it.” And a third: “It’s as if someone were out there making up pointless jobs for the sake of keeping us all working.”  &#10;&#10;Just what every commuter needs on their first day back at work, you might think. But I love these subvertisements, mainly because they are right. No one talks about the soul-crushing sadness experienced by the chronically exhausted and unfulfilled hordes. Forget the garbage disposal: we’re in urgent need of an army of pooper-scooper-wielding refuseniks, because bullshit jobs are everywhere.  &#10;&#10;Such is the nature of neoliberalism, of this service-based economy that has been created for us. “What does he actually do?” you might think of your friend. “In fact, what do I actually do? What does anyone do?” (This is where your brain melts out of your ears into a puddle at your feet, only to be spooned back into your docile mouth by a grinning David Cameron while George Osborne sponge-bathes your naked body with tax breaks.)  &#10;&#10;Of course, complaining about any of this or doing something as daring as opting out finds you guilty of the most conspicuous of crimes against capitalism: laziness. Or a suspicious lack of ambition, resulting in the label of “scrounger” if you’re working class and that of “pampered entitled millennial with no moral backbone” if you’re middle class. But don’t despair: humans have an incredible capacity for survival. There are ways to endure the pointlessly mundane jobs that many of us do. Here are my tips:  &#10;&#10;One of the most level-headed people I know sets very little store in his job when it comes to defining himself as a human being. Instead, it’s the things he does outside of work that he regards as his main means of personal fulfilment. Guy Debord regarded maximum pleasure as the central aim of any revolution, so start your own personal one, via music or reading or sex or anything that you enjoy doing creatively. Then pour your soul into these activities instead of thinking about work. If you can do one of these activities during working hours, even better.  &#10;&#10;Not people who use the word “facetime” as a way of describing hanging out, or talk about things “going forward”. These people will be first up against the wall. I mean family and friends, people you love. Love is the answer (actually, anaesthetising yourself with drink and drugs is the answer, but unfortunately it’s less slimming).  &#10;&#10;This sounds flippant but can actually be an effective means of delaying job- induced madness. A friend who worked stacking shelves in Tesco overnight was able to keep his sanity by pretending he was playing a game of foodstuff-sized Tetris. In a similar vein, you could see how many Cradle of Filth lyrics you can subtly weave into your customer service emails, wreak subtle psychological havoc upon your colleagues, or, if you’re a hairdresser, deliberately give everyone terrible haircuts for your own amusement (my hairdresser has been doing this for years).  &#10;&#10;The biggest modern lie is the one told by the Steve Jobses of this world: that, career-wise, we must do what we love in order to experience true happiness. It’s a lovely thought but, unfortunately for the generation sold this nonsense by idealistic baby-boomers, a fulfilling job is a luxury, not a given. Instead, as some means of twisted compensation, we’re offered slave wages, zero-hours contracts and made-up job titles. But as depressing as things look, it’s important to keep hold of those youthful aspirations and harness them, if not for financial profit, then for sanity’s sake.  &#10;&#10;It’s exhausting, I know, especially as in Britain we work the longest hours in Europe. You are right to be furious. We all are. In the words of the retro anarchist-punk soundbite dusted off by Russell Brand: “Let’s have a revolution, yeah?” (At least after a short nap.) Let’s continue to campaign for better and more flexible working hours, wages that people can actually survive on, and freedom from harassment and exploitation. Let’s vote. Let’s join our unions. Let’s take the bastards to tribunal (whoops, no legal aid). Because if you’re going to do a bullshit job, you might as well get what you can out of it.

255-torturecrimetimeendimpunit	aljazeera	Thu, 11 Dec 2014 12:56:18 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/torture-crime-time-end-impunit-2014121111328822568.html	Rob Freer	Torture is a crime, time to end the impunity	This week the world has seen headline after headline about the CIA's horrifying practise of systematic torture and cruelty: Mentions of "rectal hydration" and rape threats, sleep and sensory deprivation, forced nudity, stress positions, subjection to cold temperatures, food deprivation, hanging from bars, confinement in a "coffin size" box, hooding, and physical assaults; a man left shackled and naked to die overnight in a secret CIA facility in Afghanistan; psychologists contracted to design the best ways to break the human spirit; doctors ensuring that victims were fit to endure more torture.  &#10;&#10;These were violations of the most fundamental human rights and crimes under international law. But still, no promises to bring any of those responsible to justice.  &#10;&#10;It has been known for years that the US turned to torture as part of its response to the crime against humanity that was committed on September 11, 2001. Today, the cruelty carried out in the CIA secret detention programme run under authority granted by President George W Bush still has the power to shock and sicken. While the CIA may have exceeded its authority and lied to him, he still had a part to play.  &#10;&#10;But we must not forget that behind the text of the summary report by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) and the details contained within, are cases of real people. People whose lives have been broken, whose humanity was forgotten under this state-sanctioned programme.  &#10;&#10;The case of Abu Zubaydah has long been known. Amnesty International first raised its concerns with the US government in April 2002. He was the first person to be taken into CIA custody considered by the agency to have high intelligence value. Abu Zubaydah was effectively treated as a human guinea pig to test the CIA's emerging interrogation regime. He was subjected to a range of torture methods, including being waterboarded multiple times.  &#10;&#10;The SSCI summary adds some new chilling details. A July 15, 2002 cable sent by the interrogation team at "Detention Site Green", believed to be in Thailand, ended: "In light of the planned psychological pressure techniques to be implemented, we need to get reasonable assurances that [Abu Zubaydah] will remain in isolation and incommunicado for the remainder of his life." CIA officers responded that "all major players are in concurrence that [Abu Zubaydah] should remain incommunicado for the rest of his life".  &#10;&#10;Then, after Abu Zubaydah had been subjected to 47 days of complete isolation, he was subjected to numerous "enhanced interrogation techniques" including physical assaults, stress positions, cramped confinement, white noise, and sleep deprivation "in varying combinations, 24 hours a day for 17 straight days".  &#10;&#10;Reports were constantly fed back to top authorities. Daily cables sent from "Detention Site Green" to CIA headquarters recorded that Abu Zubaydah frequently "cried", "begged", "pleaded", and "whimpered". At times, he was "hysterical" and "distressed to the level that he was unable to effectively communicate". Waterboarding sessions would result in "hysterical pleas", and on at least one occasion, Abu Zubaydah "became completely unresponsive" until he received medical attention.  &#10;&#10;Abu Zubaydah's ordeal is not yet over. After four and a half years in secret CIA custody he was transferred to Guantanamo, where he remains today. He has never been charged with any crime. The injustice continues.  &#10;&#10;On August 5, 2002, at the same time that Abu Zubaydah was being tortured in Thailand, CIA headquarters approved an interrogation plan for Ridha al-Najjar at another secret facility, dubbed "Detention Site Cobalt", believed to be the Salt Pit facility in Afghanistan.  &#10;&#10;The interrogation plan for Najjar included isolation in total darkness, lowering the quality of his food, keeping him in cold temperatures, 24-hour-a-day loud music, shackling and hooding. Over one two-day period, he was left with his wrists handcuffed to an overhead bar for 22 hours a day in order to "break his resistance". On September 21, 2002, his interrogators sent a cable describing Najjar as "clearly a broken man" and "on the verge of complete breakdown". His detention and interrogation "became the model" for the treatment of detainees at that facility, according to the SSCI.  &#10;&#10;Twelve years later, Najjar remains in US custody in Bagram, Afghanistan. He has never been charged or tried, and is still being denied his right to challenge his detention in court. A petition on his behalf is currently pending before the US Supreme Court.  &#10;&#10;The psychological impact of such intense cruelty has devastated those subjected to it. According to the SSCI, many detainees "exhibited psychological and behavioural issues, including hallucinations, paranoia, insomnia, and attempts at self-harm and self-mutilation".  &#10;&#10;Majid Khan, who was held in secret CIA custody for three and a half years before being transferred in 2006 to Guantanamo, where he remains today, is said to have engaged in numerous acts of self-harm, including "attempting to cut his wrist on two occasions, to chew into his arm at the inner elbow, cut a vein in the top of his foot and into his skin at the elbow joint using a filed toothbrush".  &#10;&#10;As the world struggles to comprehend the details in the summary it is important to remember all we've been given is a snapshot, a peek through the keyhole to the dark secrets hidden within. The report released yesterday is just a summary of a full report that runs to 6,700 pages. That report describes the detention and interrogation of 119 detainees held by the CIA. Senator Dianne Feinstein said that "decisions will be made at a later date" as to whether the whole report will be declassified and released. Amnesty International believes this should be done sooner rather than later, indeed should be set in motion now.  &#10;&#10;The Senate committee also needs to address the fact that the US human rights violations and crimes went beyond torture. The CIA detainees were subjected to enforced disappearance - which, like torture, is a crime under international law.  &#10;&#10;No one has been brought to justice for these crimes. This accountability gap leaves the US squarely on the wrong side of its international obligations. Those responsible, no matter their current or previous level of office, must be brought to justice, along with those in other countries that colluded with the CIA to facilitate these programmes.  &#10;&#10;December 10 marked 30 years since the adoption of the Convention Against Torture - an anniversary which the US would do well not to gloss over.  &#10;&#10;The US ratified the treaty in 1994. President Obama should make a public commitment to end the impunity being enjoyed by those who authorised and carried out the crimes committed in the CIA programmes of rendition, interrogation and detention.  &#10;&#10;And victims should be offered redress - most urgently they must be offered treatment to help them overcome the trauma to which they were unlawfully exposed. If they have committed crimes they should be prosecuted and punished for them, but as victims, they too deserve justice.  &#10;&#10;Laying out a catalogue of abuses is not enough. There must be accountability too.  	US human rights violations and crimes went beyond torture.&#10;&#10;
256-torturingmuslimsanawesomewa	aljazeera	Sun, 14 Dec 2014 03:22:14 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/torturing-muslims-an-awesome-wa-201412149282554942.html	Dexter Thomas	Torturing Muslims is an 'awesome' way to get things done	On December 9, the Senate Select Committee released a partial report of the horrifying, illegal torture tactics used by the CIA during the Bush administration. Some question the timing. I think the timing is perfect.  &#10;&#10;We are now in a position to recall what past black activists, from Martin Luther King to Angela Davis to Muhammad Ali, knew when they spoke against the immoral actions of their nation in Vietnam. The protesters in Ferguson got a sneak peek, or a reminder, of this lesson in August, when Palestinians, who had experience with being shot at with US-made weaponry, advised US protesters on how to treat the searing pain of tear gas bombs (pour Coca-Cola directly over the eyes).  &#10;&#10;But recently, because of the quick succession of the failures to indict the killers of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, and then the release of the torture report, we are at a moment in which the link between our domestic terrorism and our international terrorism is being drawn for the rest of us.  &#10;&#10;Immediately after the release of the report, many in the media did their best to claim that the release of this report was part of some wider conspiracy to demoralise Americans. The best example of this would be Fox News' Andrea Tantaros, who, in the middle of a conversation about the report, began shouting that "The United States of America is awesome, we are awesome." She seemed positively indignant that the Obama administration was attempting to "have this discussion to show us how we're not awesome".  &#10;&#10;For those unfamiliar with the slang of US hipsters and teenagers, we generally use the "awesome/not awesome" binary to evaluate things like pizza, beer, or surfboards - not the moral character of a nation-state.  &#10;&#10;But, if we are to adopt her method of expression, Tantaros seems to be forgetting that she is able to be on television in part because one or two generations ago, a few people declared that women not being able to participate in news media was not very "awesome". She also forgets that a couple generations before that, her Greek last name would have prevented her from being considered "white", and she thus would not have been allowed in front of a camera. Whether Tantaros accepts it or not, the history of equality in the US has been one of people deciding that things were not yet awesome, and taking it upon themselves to make them more awesome.  &#10;&#10;But we should note that Tantaros was primarily angry at being forced to have a public conversation, and at being embarrassed that the world was seeing us have a discussion about our behaviour. "This makes us look bad," she pleaded. "And all this does is have our enemies laughing at us."  &#10;&#10;Not only is torture illegal, but by US' own standards, it is ineffective. The CIA knew this. The 1992 US Army Field Manual on Interrogation explicitly advises that "the use of force is a poor technique, as it yields unreliable results", and can "induce the source to say whatever he thinks the interrogator wants to hear". This ended up being true - we now know that one prisoner told the CIA that he was trying to recruit black Muslims in the US to attack gas stations. He later admitted that he made up the story, "because he thought that's what interrogators wanted to hear".  &#10;&#10;This year has also shown us that ineptitude can also happen at home, with our domestic police forces. The Ferguson Police Department has utterly failed to de-escalate tensions at every possible opportunity. We now know the officer that killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice was not fit to hold a pistol, much less a badge. In fact, a report by the Justice Department has shown that Cleveland police officers routinely use unjustified force in arrests, and fire their weapons "carelessly", putting both innocent bystanders and themselves in danger.  &#10;&#10;If the timing of the one-two punch of public revelations of anti-black racism and criminal torture do not convince us, then we can at least recognise a pattern in the people that are desperate to deny both.  &#10;&#10;The torture report is available to anyone to view online, provided they are willing to wade through pages and pages of gruesome accounts. There is an account of putting a prisoner in a diaper, shackling him to the ceiling, and leaving him for days.  &#10;&#10;One prisoner died of hypothermia after being chained, nearly naked, to a concrete floor. Many were sexually assaulted. Despite this, Republican Congressman Peter King attempted to wave these facts away, declaring that no harmful torture occurred. Instead, he brushed it off as merely a few "people made to stand in awkward positions".  &#10;&#10;This is the same Peter King who said that Eric Garner did not die because of a chokehold, but because he was overweight. It is also the same Peter King that implied that Garner, in his final moments, was lying about not being able to breathe.  &#10;&#10;If Tantaros' reaction to the defiling of the "awesomeness" of the US seems childish, Peter King's reaction is worse. It is the rhetorical equivalent of sticking your fingers in your ears, and shouting "nyah, nyah, I can't hear you" - as your brother drowns beside you.  &#10;&#10;And, as if we needed any clearer indication on how racism and callousness regarding the torture of non-whites were connected, we were given a clear reminder last week, when Facebook released a 23 second commercial about a feature of its service, and cast a Sikh man as the spokesperson. The video was immediately bombarded with angry comments calling the man an "ISIL terrorist", a "raghead", and a "sand nigger". One commenter blasted Facebook itself, asking "Why do you have a Muslim on this pic?" When another user replied that he was a Sikh, the commenter responded: "Same thing."  &#10;&#10;We might chalk this up to ignorance: Our education system is focused on white European and US history. Most Americans don't know the difference between a friendly Sikh man and a scary Muslim terrorist. Actually, most Americans couldn't tell you the difference between a fatwah and a plate of chapati. But we should be more precise here - it's not that we don't know, it's that we don't want to know.  &#10;&#10;But then again, separating "good" brown people from "bad" ones isn't the point, and wouldn't make a difference. For too many of us, anyone brown and bearded is automatically al-Qaeda, and deserves to be tortured and killed. Our understanding of humanity does not apply to anyone that can be mistaken for Muslim or Arab, and we excuse ourselves for this moral exception by constantly reminding ourselves that our country was attacked in 2001. It's not that we can't know that we are terrorising black people. It's not that we can't know that the people we tortured in those prisons were people. We could, if we wanted to. But we don't want to.  &#10;&#10;The events of the past few months have shown us that we are not up against a few crooked cops, a group of rogue rednecks, or a wacky news station. We are up against an empire of immorality that, in its fear, would rather shoot and waterboard the world, than to learn about it. If there is a true "enemy", it is that Empire. It has been hiding in plain sight, and this year, it has revealed itself - in the mirror. As Tantaros says, it laughs at us.  &#10;&#10;What we choose to do about that is up to us.  	Ferguson and the CIA torture report draw the connection between US domestic&#10;and international terrorism.&#10;&#10;
257-towntoldtokeepchristoutchristm	foxnews	2014-12-04T19:06:33Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/12/04/town-told-to-keep-christ-out-christmas-parade/	Todd Starnes	Town told to keep Christ out of Christmas parade	Piedmont, Alabama (WBRC - Fox 6)  &#10;&#10;The annual Christmas parade in Piedmont, Alabama is a big deal in this small town tucked away in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.  &#10;&#10;The Piedmont parade doesn’t have giant helium-filled balloons or dancing Broadway show girls – but they do have the local high school marching band and Santa Claus parades down North Main Street on a bright red fire truck. And just about every girl who’s ever won a beauty pageant will be riding on a float.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;“We’ve got beautiful girls in Alabama,” Mayor Bill Baker told me.  &#10;&#10;This year’s grand marshal is the Piedmont High School track team – state champions – the pride of the town.  &#10;&#10;“We try to honor our kids and we try to give recognition to those who do well,” Mayor Baker said. “We’re proud to have them leading the parade.”  &#10;&#10;But the town also wanted to honor the “reason for the season” and that landed them in a world of trouble with a group of out-of-town atheists.  &#10;&#10;CLICK HERE TO FOLLOW TODD ON FACEBOOK FOR CONSERVATIVE CONVERSATION!  &#10;&#10;The parade committee selected “Keep Christ in Christmas” as the theme of Thursday night’s parade. Seeing how there’s a church on nearly every street corner in town – no one gave it a second thought.  &#10;&#10;“It was a great theme,” the mayor said. “I was totally shocked when I received the letter. It’s a small town. It’s a small Christmas parade. We didn’t think there would be any problems at all.”  &#10;&#10;Little did the mayor know that his town was about to be infested with an ill- tempered gaggle of atheists from Wisconsin – the Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF).  &#10;&#10;They alleged that a single person in Piedmont had complained about the parade theme – and the FFRF sent the mayor a threatening letter.  &#10;&#10;The theme “alienates non-Christians and others in Piedmont who do not in fact have a ‘strong belief in prayers’ by turning them into political outsiders in their own community,” FFRF attorney Andrew Seidel wrote. “The sentiment of ‘Keeping Christ in Christmas’ does not qualify as a secular celebration.”  &#10;&#10;They told the city to find a “more appropriate, more inclusive, and constitutional theme” for the parade.  &#10;&#10;It’s not the first time that the perpetually offended atheists have targeted Piedmont. Earlier this year, they demanded that the local high school stop reciting prayers before football games.  &#10;&#10;“Somebody filed a complaint and we had to stop that,” the mayor said. Well, to be accurate – they sort of stopped praying.  &#10;&#10;And from that point on folks would gather on the football field before the game.  &#10;&#10;“And as citizens, we recited the Lord’s Prayer – out loud,” Mayor Baker said. “One week we had the entire football field encircled by people. It was really wonderful and very moving to me to see people come together and praise God and speak His name out loud.”  &#10;&#10;The prayer controversy was one of the reasons why the parade committee wanted to make a statement during the Christmas parade.  &#10;&#10;Unfortunately, the city attorney told the mayor that the theme violated the law – there was nothing they could do.  &#10;&#10;But the folks around Piedmont are not the kind of folks who back away from a fight. They’re a pretty resourceful bunch.  &#10;&#10;While they agreed to not officially have a parade theme – the city has decided to keep Christ in Christmas in other ways.  &#10;&#10;“Nothing has really changed,” the mayor told me. “We still have the same religious floats. We still have the churches. We still have the beauty queens. We’re still going to have this wonderful Christian parade regardless of if we have a theme or not.”  &#10;&#10;And they also found a way to legally keep Christ in the parade. They mayor said local citizens will be marching with signs reading “Let’s Keep Christ in Christmas.”  &#10;&#10;“They paid their entry fees,” the mayor said. “It’s a positive march – it’s not a protest march. They are keeping the theme alive even though legally we had to do away with it.”  &#10;&#10;The mayor is a kind-hearted fellow – but he’s not one to be trifled with – and he’s none too pleased with the out-of-town atheists.  &#10;&#10;“It annoys me that a small group of people can do what they do and get away with it and the majority has to suffer,” the mayor said. “They are infringing on my beliefs.”  &#10;&#10;And he also had some words of advice for the one person in town who complained.  &#10;&#10;“I’d like to tell that one person – whoever he or she is – if they even exist – to stay at home,” he said. “If they don’t like a Christian theme, if they don’t like a Christian parade – stay at home.”  &#10;&#10;Ironically, all the recent controversy has been a good thing – a blessing in disguise, the mayor said.  &#10;&#10;“The town has rallied,” he told me. “I appreciate all the citizens who got on Facebook and the telephone and talked to each other. It’s heartwarming to me to see the Christian response that has developed.”  &#10;&#10;So if you happen to be in North Alabama tonight, be sure to drop by the parade. Miss Piedmont will be there – along with Miss Calendar. The local Boy Scout troop will be hoisting Old Glory and you might even get a candy cane from Old Saint Nick – provided there’s not a last minute fire.  &#10;&#10;Merry Christmas, Piedmont. Thank you for keeping Christ in Christmas.  	The annual Christmas parade in Piedmont, Alabama is a big deal in this small&#10;town tucked away in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.&#10;&#10;
258-trapinsecurityextrajudicialki	aljazeera	Mon, 08 Dec 2014 05:28:02 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/trap-insecurity-extrajudicial-ki-20141288552608186.html	Abdullahi Boru Halakhe	The trap of insecurity: Extrajudicial killings in Kenya	Over the years, Kenyan police have acquired a dubious reputation of being a source of insecurity instead of one of security. In many instances, the police represent clear, palpable and imminent danger to the lives of Kenyan citizens.  &#10;&#10;The transformation of the police from a security institution into a bastion of insecurity didn't occur overnight, nor did it come as a surprise; it was the inevitable outcome of a number of factors. Some of these factors are beyond their control. For instance, policemen are underpaid and ill-equipped to do their job; others seem to be an institutional choice, such as the endemic corruption within the police force.  &#10;&#10;Under the previous constitution, the police were at the beck and call of the executive, which used it as a tool of coercion to further its political goals. As a result, when confronted by a new security situation, the executive's default response has been to set up a "special" police unit to address the situation. In most cases, t he unit would operate under minimum oversight and maximum impunity.  &#10;&#10;More than any other institution in the country, the police has deep institutional problems, but one of the most detrimental ones is its involvement in extrajudicial killings . Remarkably, this is not only a new phenomenon, but it is deeply entrenched with a clear pattern.  &#10;&#10;In the 1990s, crime was on the rise in Kenya. In order to stem the high rates of carjacking and violent robberies, in 1995 the government formed a new police unit called the Flying Squad . This special unit was given the express authority to shoot any suspect on sight without due process. As a result, the unit was implicated in multiple and egregious extrajudicial killings, which they claimed was their way of dealing with the new security reality. In some cases, the police officers were caught shooting suspects after they had surrendered or were lying face down.  &#10;&#10;The unit executed several innocent people in cold blood. The police command instead of seeing the unit's trigger-happy attitude as dangerous, celebrated it as the only "medicine" with which to treat spiralling crime.  &#10;&#10;The late 1980s and 1990s saw deep economic problems, shrinking political space for dissent and increasing insecurity. This was the time when criminal gangs emerged and flourished.  &#10;&#10;These gangs e stablished their "spheres of influence", mostly in slum areas, where the state's presence was negligible. To establish loyalty from the community and enhance their legitimacy, these groups provided security for a token fee. To exert their superiority, from time to time, these groups engaged each other over "territories" and business interests. Among these groups were the Mungiki, the Taliban, the Kosovo boys, the Baghdad boys, Chinkororo, and the Kalenjin Warriors.  &#10;&#10;Mungiki is a Kikuyu word for multitude. The organisation had both a cultural and political element to it. In the beginning of the group's existence, the social aspect was more prominent and it involved traditional Kikuyu beliefs in the god named Ngai . But as the organisation expanded, it began taking an overtly political posture, which brought them into confrontation with the state.  &#10;&#10;Mungiki operated primarily in the Nairobi slums, in the Central Province and parts of the Rift Valley. In these areas, the group started providing the poor in slum areas with protection and social services for a fee. Refusal to pay the protection " tax " almost always resulted in violence and killings.  &#10;&#10;In 2002, the Kenyan government banned 18 of these criminal gangs.  &#10;&#10;The spread of Mungiki's influence forced the government in 2007 to establish a special police unit called Kwekwe which was tasked primarily with hunting down members of Mungiki.  &#10;&#10;But Kwekwe's operation against the criminal group went too far.  &#10;&#10;According to a National Commission on Human Rights 2008 report: "Extrajudicial executions and other brutal acts of extreme cruelty have been perpetrated by the police against so-called Mungiki adherents and that these acts may have been committed pursuant to official policy sanctioned by the political leadership, the police commissioner and top police commander". HRW observed in 2008 that, "The brutality of the police crackdown matched or even exceeded that of the Mungiki itself."  &#10;&#10;Kenya has been in the crosshairs of the transnational jihadi movement. In the past, the fact that Kenya was seen as being firmly in the western sphere of influence made Kenya a target , with most of the incidents, including the 1998 US embassy attack, targeting western interests.  &#10;&#10;However, after Kenya's intervention in Somalia in 2011, the country itself become a target. Terrorism activity in Kenya reached a peak with the attack on the Westgate shopping mall in September 2013, when unidentified gunmen killed 67 people and injured almost 200 others.  &#10;&#10;As a response to the growing terrorism threat, the Kenyan government created the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit (ATPU) in March 2003, following the 2002 attack on an Israeli-owned Mombasa hotel. This was also accompanied by the passage of Anti-Terrorism Act in 2012. As part of the wider counterterrorism effort, the government also began a huge crackdo wn on the Somali and Muslim communities especially in Nairobi, parts of Northern Kenya and coastal Kenya.  &#10;&#10;As the crackdown intensified, a number of extrajudicial killings of Muslim preachers took place, some in the coastal city of Mombasa. Most of the victims were suspected of having connections with Somalia's al-Shabab group.  &#10;&#10;While in almost all the cases the police deny culpability, research by human rights organisations reveals the ATPU's involvement. In its August 2014 report, "Kenya: Killings, disappearance by anti-terror police," HRW points to " …evidence of at least 10 cases of extrajudicial killings of terrorism suspects, some of whom were last seen in ATPU custody or had been threatened by the unit's officers after courts had released them".  &#10;&#10;The Kenyan government has accused some of the clerics who were killed of recruiting Muslim youth for terrorism activities through their mosques. However, despite initiating investigations against them, the government never followed through to prosecute the imams.  &#10;&#10;After public outcry over the killing of Muslim cleric Ibrahim "Rogo" Omar, the government set up a task force to investigate his murder. The director of public prosecution promised in 2013 that he will institute an inquest, but has not done so yet.  &#10;&#10;One of the commissions established following the 2007-2008 violence to look at the role of the police, was the Waki Commission. Established to look into the circumstances and facts surrounding the violence and provide recommendations, the Waki Commission found that of the 1,500 deaths, the police was responsible for more than 30 percent of them.  &#10;&#10;As a result several reform measures were proposed including the establishment of a civilian oversight of the police, and many other reforms. However, due to lack of political will, the police reforms have stalled.  &#10;&#10;The extrajudicial killings by the police in Kenya are anchored in a systemic lack of accountability and deeply entrenched culture of pervasive impunity. While the police undoubtedly face ever changing security challenges, its involvement in extrajudicial killings make matters worse. Effective security sector reform is the only way forward.  	Kenya's failed security policies have led to a string of extrajudicial&#10;killings in the past decades.&#10;&#10;

The British medics sent to work at the centre raised alarm as early as November about Emergency's approaches to palliative care.  &#10;&#10;Amiodarone, a drug licenced to regulate the heartbeat, has never been tested outside of a lab setting to treat humans or animals infected with Ebola. It was neither approved by the Sierra Leonean health ministry nor listed among the 53 drugs that have an antiviral effect on Ebola.  &#10;&#10;In a report to UK Med, the British healthcare professionals argued that "the toxic side effects of Amiodarone could in fact be contributing to increased morbidity within the ETC [ebola treatment centre]". While the mortality rate at Emergency's centre is disputed - ranging from 58 and 67 percent - the death rate at centres run by Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF), for instance, ranges from 50 and 60 percent.  &#10;&#10;Most alarming is the concern that foreign-run Ebola treatment centres could be using unorthodox testing methods with impunity.  &#10;&#10;Emergency's use of Amiodarone without a proper clinical trial or patient consent prompted censure from a senior scientist about the recklessness of this approach and a walk-out over safety fears by the UK health workers sent to work at the treatment centre.  &#10;&#10;Apparently, the NGO stopped using the drug after receiving a request from the Department of International Development (DFID), which had been alerted by the British medics.  &#10;&#10;When rumours circulated early-on during the Ebola outbreak, that the virus was a form of bio warfare, critics were quick to label these ideas "conspiracy theories".  &#10;&#10;Yet, fears about western medicine being used to harm are neither irrational nor far-fetched.  &#10;&#10;As unconscionable as Emergency's practices appear, there is a long history of unethical drug testing on poor and vulnerable communities across the globe.  &#10;&#10;Perhaps one of the most famous cases of unethical experimental treatment was in 1932 when Public Health Service in the United States began the "Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male" at a time when there was no known cure for syphilis.  &#10;&#10;The study initially included 600 black men - 399 with and 201 without syphilis - most of whom were poor and illiterate sharecroppers enticed with incentives such as free medical exams, meals on examination days, and promises that their relatives would receive burial stipends in the event of their deaths.  &#10;&#10;The men were deceived into thinking that they were being treated for "bad blood". They neither received proper treatment nor were they informed of the true nature of the study. Instead of lasting for six months, as originally projected, the study went on for 40 years.  &#10;&#10;When penicillin was developed to treat syphilis in 1947, treatment was withheld from all 600 subjects. In 1973, a class action suit was filed on behalf of the men in the study and settled out of court for $9 million.  &#10;&#10;Similar experiments were held in Guatemala from 1946 to 1948, when Public Health Service infected 1,610 total soldiers, female commercial sex workers, prisoners and mental health patients with one of three sexually transmitted diseases - syphilis, gonorrhoea, or chancroid.  &#10;&#10;Like the Tuskegee experiment, none of the human subjects were informed about the nature of the study, nor did they give consent. Unlike the Tuskegee study, however, patients in Guatemala were eventually inoculated with penicillin though it is unclear how many were actually cured.  &#10;&#10;Although vulnerable adult populations have borne the brunt of unethical medical testing, children have not been spared. In the mid-nineties, the world's largest research-based drug company, Pfizer, administered the experimental drug, Trovan, during a meningitis outbreak in Kano in northern Nigeria.  &#10;&#10;The parents of eleven children who died sued Pfizer, alleging that Trovan was used without their informed consent. Pfizer eventually settled out of court in 2009, promising to pay the Kano state government $75 million.  &#10;&#10;For too long, the bodies of poor and vulnerable communities have been exploited to serve the medical fetishes of big pharmaceutical companies, research institutions and Western governments.  &#10;&#10;Yet, there is a growing tide against this warped practice. In his 2014 Reith lecture series entitled 'The Future of Medicine', renowned surgeon, writer and public health researcher Dr Atul Gawande argued convincingly that the well- being of a patient is more important than his/her "health".  &#10;&#10;Therefore, the goal of medical practice should be "caring", and not simply "curing".  &#10;&#10;In the age of Ebola, it appears that the single-minded pursuit to "cure" has somehow superseded the Hippocratic Oath to which doctors must adhere to "do no harm". The sudden race to find an antidote for Ebola - a disease that has been around since 1976 - must not serve as an excuse to experiment on patients whose internal organs are at risk of shutting down.  &#10;&#10;Unethical drug testing must be matched with harsh punishment, now and after Ebola. We must insist on a probe of the dubious treatment regime adopted by the Italian NGO Emergency, followed by criminal prosecution in the event of malpractice.  &#10;&#10;They must answer to patients at the Lakka treatment centre in Sierra Leone.  	It is time to punish unethical drug testing.&#10;&#10;

From kindergarten to high school, all students had to recite an oath of allegiance every morning at school. I still can't erase the verses from my mind: "Oh Great Ataturk, who had created our life of today; on the path that you have paved, in the country that you established, I swear to walk incessantly with the purposes that you have set."  &#10;&#10;Every Turkish citizen had to put their hearts and souls into that oath. The louder you spoke those words, the better a citizen you were.  &#10;&#10;Those days are not yet ancient history. The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) only abolished this fascist practice in 2013. It was good news, but some weren't so thrilled. Pro-Kemalist media attacked the reform package, including many democratic regulations, while their columnists harshly criticised the move because Turkey was leaving behind its worship of Ataturk.  &#10;&#10;Red lines  &#10;&#10;In the days following the global outrage over the attack on the French satirical newspaper, Charlie Hebdo, many in Turkey seem to have forgotten those days when any criticism of Ataturk was a punishable offence - one that could label you a traitor. Kemalism is not only an ideology; for many Turks, it was akin to religion. Poems depicting Ataturk as a God are evidence of an attempt to impose Kemalism as a religion.  &#10;&#10;That's why Islam, the religion of the majority of Turkish society, was seen as a threat for them. It was not enough that Ataturk was beloved by his supporters. We all had to submit to - and idolise - him.  &#10;&#10;Roland Barthes' famous words would describe what we lived then: "Fascism is not the prohibition of saying things; it is the obligation to say them."  &#10;&#10;Cumhuriyet, a leading daily newspaper of the old guard founded in 1924, has always been a symbol of Kemalism since the beginning.  &#10;&#10;The Turkish public were accustomed to their publications attacking Muslims, seeing them as a threat, despising them, or their columnists' pieces insulting Islam. On the other hand, they have always had clear red lines when it came to Kemalism. Cumhuriyet has never given a place to a critique of Ataturk or Kemalism; on the contrary, it has attacked the critics.  &#10;&#10;Last week, Cumhuriyet announced that it would publish the Charlie Hebdo cartoons in order to defend freedom expression. In so doing, they attracted a lot of reaction. Of course, the Turkish community, mostly Muslim, was dissatisfied with the daily's decision as they do not consider the insulting of religions as a manifestation of freedom of speech.  &#10;&#10;Some say the move was a provocation - or reckless at least - but the majority have regarded the decision as hypocritical. Critics on social media or even conventional media pointed out their intolerance for any criticism of Ataturk. However, the daily exaggerated the responses, chose to sail under false colours and pictured the insults and the mockery against the publication as an attack on free speech.  &#10;&#10;Freedom of speech  &#10;&#10;Islamists protested against the paper and its decision, but nothing happened. The police did pay a visit to the printing house but there were no restrictions. The government took precautions against any possible attacks on the daily but they portrayed the situation as if they were under siege.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;Charlie Hebdo is known as a satirical newspaper, which is against any authority, any halidom or any individual or group claiming supremacy. Even if we accept this - and I personally don't agree as we are familiar with Charlie Hebdo's double standards insofar as Israel - Cumhuriyet or other Kemalist publications in Turkey are certainly in no position to defend the values of freedom of speech as they have zero tolerance for any negative words of their idol, Ataturk.  &#10;&#10;On the same day, the Islamist newspaper Yeni Akit's Istanbul office was attacked with stones and eggs during a protest against its publication of beaten images of Ataturk. No so-called "freedom of speech" defenders who supported the publication of Charlie Hebdo caricatures, condemned the attack.  &#10;&#10;The Gulenist media figures who introduced themselves as Muslims announced their support for Cumhuriyet for the sake of freedom of speech; however they were silent against the attack against Yeni Akit. The Gulenist media was against Charlie Hebdo's publishing of insulting images of Prophet Muhammad until 2013 and have always been against any publication criticising their leader, Fethullah Gulen.  &#10;&#10;Their about-face on Charlie Hebdo is linked to their turn on Islam but criticising Gulen has always been a red line for them. According to Zaman daily columnist Ali Unal, criticising Gulen is tantamount to infidelity and polytheism.  &#10;&#10;In short, the Kemalists and the Gulenists have their own "gods", or their own "prophets".  &#10;&#10;Insulting Islam is freedom of speech for them, but if you dare to speak against their idols, it is blasphemy.  	For Turkey's self-styled free speech defenders, it's all about double&#10;standards and selective memory.&#10;&#10;
261-tvdebatesbroadcastersdavidcame	guardian	2015-01-14T12:40:51Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/14/tv-debates-broadcasters-david-cameron-empty-chair-treatment	Roger Mosey	TV debates: why broadcasters should give Cameron the empty chair treatment	In a short time, television debates have become a vital part of our democracy. They were watched by tens of millions of people in the 2010 general election campaign, and the Scottish referendum campaign would have been poorer without the two showdowns between Alex Salmond and Alistair Darling live across all media platforms. Now is not the time to retreat from the kind of broadcasting that engages so many voters and illuminates the choices they face.  &#10;&#10;Naturally, I hope all the major parties take part in the 2015 election debates. That will rightly remain the aim of the broadcasters. But I believe they should be resolute in the face of a refusal by one party to take part: the empty chair, or the deserted lectern, should be an option.  &#10;&#10;The BBC guidelines do not specifically cover a national leaders’ debate, but the principles they set out argue not just that they can wheel out the empty chair but that they should. On general output, BBC published editorial policy is that one reluctant participant cannot stop an item: “The refusal of an individual or an organisation to make a contribution should not be allowed to act as a veto on the appearance of other contributors.”  &#10;&#10;That is confirmed in the various election guidelines, where over the years the ability of one awkward candidate to stop a broadcast has been removed. And the BBC and other broadcasters do use the empty chair, albeit on less high-profile occasions: if a news maker is unwilling to face the cameras, best practice is to say so and to cover the topic anyway. As far back as 1987, when I was Today’s political producer, we empty-chaired Labour in a campaign debate on defence – to the fury of their leadership. But they had been given every opportunity to take part and had chosen not to, so we went ahead with the other parties and told our listeners what had happened.  &#10;&#10;There is in this current row a legitimate argument about fairness and about who takes part. The arid bureaucratic view would be that this should be based on the results of the 2010 general election and therefore be a three-way debate between David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg. The rise of Ukip and the surge in multi-party politics have muddied the waters, and the broadcasters are having to be more flexible, and I think the Greens should be somewhere in the mix.  &#10;&#10;However, I believe we can trust the BBC, ITV and Sky to come up with the right format and a proposal that offers the appropriate levels of exposure to all the parties in the UK across the whole campaign. It is for them, with the appropriate regulators, to make that judgment and not for individual politicians to seek to exclude or include their opponents.  &#10;&#10;It is, in any case, inevitable that some debates of some kind will happen. The Farage v Clegg encounter just ahead of the European election campaign was an example of the asymmetry that may now happen: it was not part of a formal coverage plan, but it was compelling viewing for anyone interested in politics and millions of people tuned in. The digital debate proposed by the Guardian, Telegraph and Google is one viable alternative; and there is nothing to stop anyone hiring a hall in Manchester and getting Miliband and Clegg to debate there. I guarantee the broadcasters would turn up, and it is significant that the opposition parties are willing to take part in debates even without the prime minister.  &#10;&#10;The broadcasters may, possibly, face a legal challenge about the allocation of national airtime, but in the court of public opinion it would be a brave act to try to close down a debate in which you have been invited to take part but have chosen not to.  &#10;&#10;I’m pleased to say that I don’t sense the broadcasters are wavering, and they are prepared to be tough. They are right – now is the time to hold firm. At a time of lack of faith in politicians, it would be the worst option to allow game-playing to block a format that the public find valuable. Electors have a right to see their potential prime ministers live and unfiltered and at length. Those who are willing to put themselves on the line should be allowed to do so. Those who don’t can watch at home and see what an empty chair looks like over 90 minutes of primetime television.  	Roger Mosey: If David Cameron refuses to take part in the leaders’ debates, broadcasters are within their rights to make his absence obvious
262-tvelectiondebatewonthappendavi	guardian	2015-01-11T00:04:36Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/11/tv-election-debate-wont-happen-david-cameron-determined	Andrew Rawnsley	Chances of a TV election debate? Choose between zilch and nada	At the time of the last election, David Cameron pronounced that TV debates were “here to stay”. It was his confident declaration that: “We will have them in every election in the future and that is a really good thing for democracy.” Many others thought so too. More than 20 million people watched some or all of them. They engaged voters in ways that we hadn’t seen before in Britain. To many, it was unthinkable that they wouldn’t become a permanent feature of the fabric of our elections. It gives me no pleasure to say that I have always had great doubts that this was really the case. For it to be true, you had to trust the Tory leader not to change his mind.  &#10;&#10;TV debates happened in 2010 only because of an unusual set of circumstances. Mr Cameron had demanded them because that is what opposition leaders nearly always do. Nick Clegg wanted to gain exposure that no previous third party leader had enjoyed. In the wake of the expenses scandal, all the parties were anxious to be seen trying to connect with alienated voters. The key was Gordon Brown. Unusually for a prime minister, he agreed to debates. His people thought he had little to lose and, in a typically Gordon Brownish way, he reckoned he would come over as the man of substance while his Tory and Lib Dem rivals would be exposed as lightweights.  &#10;&#10;It didn’t work out as Mr Brown expected. But what is most relevant to what is happening now is that it didn’t work out as Mr Cameron anticipated either. The Lib Dem leader, an unknown to many voters before the debates, shone in the first one, presenting himself as the true candidate of change to the disadvantage of David Cameron and unleashing the “Cleggmania” that now seems so long ago. On election night, I was aboard the boat in the Thames hired by the BBC. Among those also present to comment on the results was Michael Ashcroft, the Tory donor and pollster. As it became clear that his party had failed to secure a majority, he placed the blame on the TV debates. That view has since become orthodoxy in the Conservative party. Whether it is entirely true or not, it has been engraved into the Tory soul. Two people were very badly burnt: Mr Cameron himself and George Osborne, who ran the last Tory election campaign and was widely castigated by his colleagues for agreeing to the debates. The chancellor long ago told friends that he is not going to make the same mistake twice. Lynton Crosby, the prime minister’s Australian strategist, is also dead-set against TV debates. Craig Oliver, the Number 10 communications chief who has been leading the Tory side in the debate negotiations, is another key figure who believes it is all downside for them.  &#10;&#10;The first reason that David Cameron and his advisers are against debates is the traditional one. He doesn’t want to concede equality of status to his opponents. The experience of the Clegg-Farage debates during the Euro elections hardened the belief in Number 10 that debates are bad for incumbents and a gift to challengers. The view around Mr Cameron is expressed by one close ally: “If you are the incumbent, debates are heavily weighted in favour of the insurgents. It is a rigged game.”  &#10;&#10;It is not, as is often assumed, fear of Nigel Farage coming at him from the right that most worries the prime minister. His biggest concern is giving a boost to Ed Miliband. TV debates are the Labour leader’s best remaining opportunity to secure mass exposure to voters sceptical that he is up to being prime minister and get them to reconsider their view. So poor are his personal ratings, Mr Miliband might only have to turn up and string together a few half-decent sentences and more people would think better of him. The hope that their man could benefit by exceeding low expectations is why Labour is desperate for debates to happen. Which makes the Tories equally desperate for them not to happen.  &#10;&#10;The Conservatives, as we saw last week with their “dodgy dossier” about Labour’s spending plans, want to revert to an old-fashioned model of election in which the campaign is dominated by staged leaders’ tours in which the prime minister wafts around the country looking presidential and morning news conferences designed, with a bit of help from their friends in the press, to shape the campaign to a Tory agenda. So, from the off, the Conservatives have done everything in their power to prevent TV debates from happening at this election. The broadcasters and the other parties wanted to begin negotiations about the format last spring. The Tories stalled, saying they wouldn’t start talking until October. When the negotiations finally got under way, I am told, and by a variety of different sources, that the Conservatives were determined to block any progress toward agreement.  &#10;&#10;“At every stage, they sought to put obstacles in the way,” says one source. Another confirms: “The Tories kept throwing spanners in the works.” According to a third: “All the parties, including Ukip, took part in good faith except the Conservatives.” Last time around, “a heads of agreement” about the debates had been written by December. This time around, we have got to mid-January and aren’t even close to that. The last meeting was just before Christmas. “We didn’t get anywhere because of the Tories,” says one source, an account that is again corroborated by others. I have learned that a meeting between the parties and the broadcasters was scheduled for the Thursday just gone. It was cancelled at the last minute by the Conservatives. No new date has been set.  &#10;&#10;The prime minister’s latest excuse for nobbling debates is that he won’t do it unless the Greens are included. I happen to agree that the Greens ought to be represented in one debate. There is not much logic to Ofcom’s recent preliminary recommendation that Ukip and the Lib Dems should be treated as “major” parties for the purposes of allocating airtime during the campaign, but not the Greens. They have been nip and tuck with the Lib Dems in the opinion polls and quite often done better. They have had representation in the House of Commons for longer than Ukip. So I agree that it would be fair to include the Greens – and hoot with laughter to hear that argument coming out of the mouth of David Cameron. When did he become obsessed with championing the rights of minority parties? Who knew he had such a passion to debate with Natalie Bennett? In the history of political excuses, this must go down as one of the most terrible.  &#10;&#10;By running away from debates, the Tories are taking some risk with their leader’s reputation and sense of himself. Says one senior government figure: “Cameron doesn’t like being called chicken.”  &#10;&#10;If the Cameron brand is supposed to be the strong and confident leader, why is he frit of debating Ed Miliband, a man the Tories keep telling us is hopelessly weak? Won’t it simply look bad to deny TV debates to the voters? Yes, it will, but the Tories are calculating that any fuss will be short- lived, soon forgotten and, in the end, not that many voters will punish them for it, especially if their spinners can successfully sow confusion about who is responsible. The Tories also bargain that the press won’t make that big a deal of it. About that, they may be right. There was resentment among newspapers during the last campaign that their capacity to shape the agenda was reduced by the TV debates. There are journalists and editors who will be secretly happy if they don’t happen again.  &#10;&#10;As things stand, I think the chances of TV election debates happening are somewhere between zilch and nada. Could anything change that? Some suggest that the broadcasters should call David Cameron’s bluff and threaten to stage debates without him – “empty chair” him in the jargon. Labour and the Lib Dems hope this will happen. Number 10 is assuming that the BBC wouldn’t have the nerve, the other broadcasters will follow its lead, and holding a debate without Mr Cameron might anyway be a breach of the laws about election coverage. A debate between everyone but the prime minister could even suit the Tories when they want to project him as the statesman floating above the fray.  &#10;&#10;A more realistic way to flush him out would be to strip him of the Green figleaf he is using as his pretext for not debating. The broadcasters could redraft their proposal to include Natalie Bennett in one of the debates. Labour, the Lib Dems and Ukip could say that they’d be content for her to participate. I think they would. Labour and the Lib Dems aren’t keen on including the Greens, who have been taking votes off both of them, but when it comes to the crunch, they’d rather have a debate with the Greens than no debates at all. Even then, the Tories are so determined to avoid TV debates that they’d most likely concoct another pretext for sabotaging them. But at least everyone would then be crystal clear who is to blame.  	Andrew Rawnsley: Badly burnt by what happened last time, the Tories set out to sabotage the negotiations right from the start
263-ukantisemitismsurveyholocaustf	guardian	2015-01-14T16:48:34Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/14/uk-antisemitism-survey-holocaust-france-jewish-britain	Hadley Freeman	This UK antisemitism survey would have shocked my great uncle Alex	On 20 September 1943, my great uncle Alex found for the first and last time in his life that the smarts for which he would always be renowned in his family were no longer enough: he was arrested in Nice and sent to the death camps.  &#10;&#10;Alex knew what awaited him there; his older brother Jakob had done this journey already and died in Auschwitz a year before. So he dug up the floorboards of the train with his stubby fingers, slipped through the hole, lay on the track while the train rattled over him and walked back to Paris, hidden along the way by communists. He then joined the Resistance, but he never trusted France again. In later life, he gave back the Légion d’Honneur he was awarded for his war service after Charles de Gaulle described Jews in 1967 as “elite, domineering and sure of themselves”.  &#10;&#10;Are you tired of Holocaust stories? Apologies for bringing up all that “unpleasantness” again, but I’ve been thinking about Alex this week. According to a YouGov poll, 45% of Britons agreed with at least one antisemitic statement put to them, such as “Jews chase money more than other people” (endorsed by a whopping 25%), and “Jews’ loyalty to Israel makes them less loyal to Britain than other Britons” (20%).  &#10;&#10;I feel less certain about another survey this week, by the Campaign Against Antisemitism, conducted on social media, which claimed that 54% of British Jews feel they have no future in the UK. But the tenacity of antisemitic beliefs is striking even in Britain, where, according to a separate report last year by Jewish Policy Research, 47% of the British Jewish respondents felt antisemitism was not a very big problem (although 40% did feel antisemitism had increased in the past five years).  &#10;&#10;This would have astonished Alex. He adored Britain – he had been in Britain as part of the Free French before he was captured, and he often spoke about the comfort he got listening to the BBC World Service during his fighting days. I imagine it will astonish most Britons too, even those who, in a dark and unacknowledged place inside, instinctively agree with the statements posed by YouGov. You don’t have to travel too far to find them in the UK. In fact, you can just turn on the BBC.  &#10;&#10;One Jewish woman, the daughter of Holocaust survivors, told BBC reporter Tim Wilcox this week that the horrific murder of four people in a kosher supermarket made her worry about the return of Jewish persecution. “Many critics, though, of Israel’s policy would suggest that the Palestinians suffer hugely at Jewish hands as well,” Wilcox said – all but saying: “So swings and roundabouts, really.”  &#10;&#10;Wilcox later apologised on Twitter for a “poorly phrased” question, as though the problem here was one of grammar. Only two months previously this same reporter, in an on-air discussion about Miliband losing Jewish support, said: “A lot of these prominent Jewish faces will be very much against the political mansion tax, presumably.” They most certainly will! You know what those Jews are like – always watching their massive pile of shekels, with their prominent faces and their prominent noses.  &#10;&#10;Now we turn to Paris, where the terrible events of last week would not have surprised Alex nearly as much. There were an astonishing number of attacks on Jews and synagogues in France last year, with the result that twice as many Jews emigrated to Israel in 2014 than the year before.  &#10;&#10;Since the awful killings there has been plenty of talk from the media and politicians about how we all mustn’t let this atrocity give rise to an anti- Muslim backlash. This is right and good. But can we take a few minutes to look at the lash itself, as well as dealing with the backlash? Four Jewish people were killed because they were in a Jewish supermarket, yet this inconvenient truth has been relatively little remarked upon, certainly compared with the angsting over the parameters of free speech at Charlie Hebdo, or commentary about the irony of the terrorists killing a fellow Muslim, the police officer Ahmed Merabet.  &#10;&#10;Is this because killing Jews is seen as par for the course when it comes to terrorist attacks? Because that does seem to be true. Going back to the attacks in Mumbai in 2008, the killers specifically sought out a Jewish community, Nariman House, and tortured and killed six Jews, including the Rabbi and his wife. The Taj Hotel has become the symbol of the Mumbai attacks but, according to some reports, it was actually Nariman House that was the terrorists’ main target. Already the killer of the Jewish people in the supermarket is being referred to, incorrectly, as “the Charlie Hebdo killer”.  &#10;&#10;So just par for the course? Maybe, but I don’t think that’s quite what’s happening here. Jews are, as the YouGov report made very clear, seen as a pretty dominant people: in charge of the media, you know. And Hollywood too. Elite, domineering and sure of themselves. So when they are attacked, there is a sense that – well, they kinda brought this on themselves, and there are other groups that are less elite that need more looking after.  &#10;&#10;I’m not sure why this is an either/or situation. A person can be horrified by anti-Muslim prejudice and also terrified by the attacks on Jews, and to talk about one is not an endorsement of the other. For a BBC reporter to balance the killing of Jews in Paris against the atrocities in Palestine is the definition of idiocy. Not as bad as expressing outright sympathy with the killer of the Jews, as the reliably idiotic “comedian” Dieudonné M’Bala M’Bala did on Facebook, but still bad. This is not the victim Olympics, with only one possible “winner”. These were people who were killed, not political statements.  &#10;&#10;My great uncle Alex led a wonderful life after the war as an art dealer, but, as I said, he never again trusted the country that had betrayed him so badly. When I asked once why he refused to keep his paintings in a bank vault, preferring instead to keep them hidden in his house, he replied: “Because they always come for the Jews.” Plus ça change.

264-ukraineopportunitywar	aljazeera	Fri, 12 Dec 2014 04:25:59 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/ukraine-opportunity-war-2014121295227421759.html	Mykola Riabchuk	Ukraine: The opportunity of war 	Perhaps the most unexpected result of the Russian-Ukrainian war - at least for its instigators ­- is the increasing support of Ukrainian citizens for all the things that the war was designed to destroy, revert, or undermine.  &#10;&#10;Despite the challenges of war, the economic crisis and political difficulties, Ukrainians are committed to endure in the face of Russian aggression and pursue the dreams of a democratic and stable Ukraine that the Maidan protests inspired. This is their opportunity to undo the oligarchic kleptocracy they were living in and build a state that enshrines the rule of law and egalitarianism.  &#10;&#10;Just within half a year, from April to November, the popular support for Ukraine's EU membership grew from 55 to 64 percent, whereas their propensity for the Moscow-led Customs Union declined from 24 percent to 17. Support for Ukraine's membership in NATO that had been traditionally very low (around 15 percent) since the 1999 NATO bombardment of Yugoslavia and the US illegal invasion of Iraq, has reached 51 percent, with 24 percent still undecided.  &#10;&#10;Russian President Vladimir Putin's popularity in Ukraine plummeted from solid the 60-70 percent in the past years to single digits. Support for a "common state" with Russia declined from the impressive 15-20 percent in the past to 5 percent, while insistence on establishing closed borders and a visa regime with Russia quadrupled - from 11 to 45 percent. And, despite the Kremlin's incredible investments in propaganda, only 5 percent of Ukrainian respondents say they trust Russian media, while Ukrainian media are trusted by some 67 percent.  &#10;&#10;Within the year, the number of self-defined "patriots of Ukraine" increased from 81 to 86 percent, and the support for national independence consolidated from 61 to 76 percent, whereas opposition to it declined from 28 per cent to 12. The worst news for Putin might be that both the Ukrainian-speaking and Russian-speaking populations are committed to independence, albeit unequally. Some 91 percent of Ukrainian speakers, 71 percent of bilinguals and 45 percent of Russian speakers support the country's independence; 30 percent of the latter do not support it.  &#10;&#10;Another, perhaps even more unexpected result of the war is the persistent optimism of many Ukrainians, despite the daily war casualties in Donbas, the disruption of electricity in many regions outside the capital Kiev, the devaluation of the Ukrainian currency, the 20 percent inflation, the 7 percent economic decline and the prospect of further economic contraction at about 4 percent next year. All gloomy facts notwithstanding, the number of self- professed optimists increased in a year from 12 to 24 percent, and the number of those who look forward with hope grew from 38 to 51 percent, while the number of those who feel hopeless fell down from 16 percent to 8.  &#10;&#10;The government still is trusted by the majority of the people. In November, 52 percent expressed their confidence in the prime minister, and 49 percent in the president - both higher than the rating President Barack Obama has in the US.  &#10;&#10;A survey asked Ukrainians shortly before the October parliamentary elections what kind of MPs they would like to see in the next Parliament; 81 percent of the respondents chose from the broad list of hypothetic MPs first of all "those who are realistic and open about Ukraine's economy and ready to implement radical, sometimes painful reforms".  &#10;&#10;It is clear that the conflict in Donbas has encouraged Ukrainians' readiness to accept difficult but much-needed reforms. The comfort of low gas prices and Russia's overwhelming political and economic presence in the country tamed the urge for reform for years, but Russian military aggression has rekindled it.  &#10;&#10;The list of the urgent reforms is extensive and includes virtually all public spheres. Three of them are particularly essential: economy (with the energy sector having the highest priority), justice, and defence.  &#10;&#10;So far, Ukraine had allegedly benefitted from the artificially low prices in the energy trade with Russia. It seems, increasingly, that that kind of trade was beneficial primarily, if not exclusively, for the narrow circle of people on both sides of the pipeline. Multiple and arbitrarily defined prices provided them with an excellent opportunity for double book-keeping, smuggling, resale, and many more murky business transactions that created dozens of billionaires, not only in energy-rich Russia but also in energy-poor Ukraine.  &#10;&#10;Not a single government in the past dared to kill the chicken that was laying golden eggs. None of them ever exposed the national "Naftogaz" company to an international audit. Nobody - either on the Ukrainian side or the Russian - submitted their bitterly disputed cases to the international arbitrage, which apparently required the disclosure of all books.  &#10;&#10;One may say that the energy sector reform is a litmus test for any Ukrainian government. No other reforms would be possible without eradication of this major source of corruption, shadowy business and clientelism. All other reforms - like economic transparency, deregulation, decentralisation, reform of the court system and the law-enforcement agencies - largely depend on the success of this one.  &#10;&#10;So far, the window of opportunity is still open and the government still has a chance to pull the country out of the post-Soviet morass. Ukrainians have invested much hope in national independence, in the Orange revolution, and in the Euromaidan. Not all of them, of course, but certainly the most active, entrepreneurial, future-oriented part of society that grew up, within the past two decades, in both its size and civic maturity. They will not stop their westward drive and their pressure on any government to meet the demands of Maidan.  &#10;&#10;It becomes increasingly clear that Moscow's primary goal is no to occupy Ukraine, but to destabilise it and preclude real and lasting reforms. Moscow wants Kiev back to normal: fully emasculated, obedient and subservient, embracing the "Eurasian" way of development - of crony capitalism, authoritarian arbitrariness, lawlessness, and rabid anti-westernism.  &#10;&#10;Successful, European Ukraine will be a deadly blow to Putinism as an embodiment of that broadly advertised anti-European alternative. This is why the Kremlin has never spared efforts to promote the idea of Ukraine as a "failed state", arguably "artificial" and incapable of independent development without external (naturally Russian) supervision. And if the covert means do not work - as they did after the Orange revolution - the overt military invasion is put into action.  &#10;&#10;However formidable and subversive Russia's strategy is, the real makers of Ukraine's either success or failure are still at home. It is up to Ukrainians to complete their unfinished post-1989 revolution.  &#10;&#10;They are suffering severely for lagging behind other Eastern European states. Putin's Russia is certainly not Gorbachev's or Yeltsin's, but Ukraine is not the same either. Today it has the opportunity, the will and the potential to transform into a stable and transparent democracy.  	Russian military aggression against Ukraine has united Ukrainians in their&#10;desire to reform their state.&#10;&#10;
265-unbrokenwhererestlouiszamperin	foxnews	2014-12-23T13:01:47Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/12/23/unbroken-where-rest-louis-zamperini-story/	Cal Thomas	'Unbroken': Where's the rest of Louis Zamperini's story?	FILE -- May 9, 2014: Louis Zamperini speaks at a news conference in Pasadena, Calif. (AP)  &#10;&#10;I wanted to like the movie because I love the book. Laura Hillenbrand\'s bestseller, "Unbroken," is a classic.  &#10;&#10;While I had heard reports that the turning point in the book never made it to film, I attended a pre-release screening with an open mind.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Audiences are told "Unbroken" is a "true story." It is true, as far as it goes, but the story is incomplete.  &#10;&#10;There have been many World War II stories told in film depicting triumphs of personal courage and survival. The story of Louis Zamperini is one such story, but with an added dimension. Zamperini, who died earlier this year at age 97, came home an angry man.  &#10;&#10;He became addicted to alcohol and cigarettes and verbally abused his young wife as he wrestled with his inner demons. The skeleton of his story is in the film -- the plane crash at sea while on a rescue mission; the 47 days floating on a raft before being picked up by a Japanese ship and thrown into a prison camp; the relentless torture and eventual liberation at the end of the war.  &#10;&#10;After returning to Los Angeles we see Zamperini hugging his brother and parents, but the story ends there.  &#10;&#10;Director Angelina Jolie attempts to put some flesh on the bones at the end of the film with some still shots and words that tell us that Zamperini\'s faith led him to return to Japan on a personal mission of reconciliation.  &#10;&#10;In media appearances, Jolie has refused to discuss why the most remarkable part of Zamperini\'s story was excluded from the film. That would be the night he was converted at the 1949 Billy Graham crusade in Los Angeles.  &#10;&#10;As Hillenbrand tells it in her book, Louis came home, poured his alcohol down the drain, threw out his cigarettes, was reconciled to his wife and became a new man because, he said, he had asked Jesus Christ to be his savior.  &#10;&#10;As stories about faith have made a recent comeback on TV and in movies, attracting high ratings and large ticket sales at the box office, it is puzzling why Jolie, who directed the film, and the Coen brothers, who wrote it, left out the most important part of Zamperini\'s story.  &#10;&#10;Once word gets around that Zamperini\'s conversion, which was so faithfully and beautifully chronicled in Hillenbrand\'s book, is not in the film, I suspect many who share Louis\' faith will not buy tickets.  &#10;&#10;Apologists for Universal Pictures say people can always read the rest of the story in the book.  &#10;&#10;Yes, they can, but then why should they see a film that highlights only half a life?  &#10;&#10;Just before he died, Jolie showed Zamperini a rough cut of the film. He professed to like it and said it doesn\'t force religion down people\'s throats.  &#10;&#10;That\'s a cliche, which doesn\'t really fit in this instance. Nothing is "forced" when it is true.  &#10;&#10;The film, "Selma," which is scheduled for release on January 9, would be incomplete if it failed to depict Martin Luther King Jr. as a minister whose faith motivated him to be a modern-day Moses.  &#10;&#10;Fortunately, in addition to Hillenbrand\'s book, people can read Louis\' story in his own words. His book is titled, "Don\'t Give Up, Don\'t Give In: Lessons from an Extraordinary Life." The One who preserved his life to the end is more powerful than his Japanese prison camp abuser.  &#10;&#10;In the film "Kings Row," Ronald Reagan awakens to learn that a botched operation has resulted in the amputation of his legs. "Where\'s the rest of me?" he asks.  &#10;&#10;Where\'s the rest of Zamperini\'s story is the question I had after seeing "Unbroken."  	As author Laura Hillenbrand tells it in her book, "Unbroken," Louis Zamperini&#10;came home, poured his alcohol down the drain, threw out his cigarettes, was&#10;reconciled to his wife and became a new man because, he said, he had asked&#10;Jesus Christ to be his savior.&#10;&#10;

Heroic movements in each century fought to lessen economic inequality, white supremacy, and gender oppression. Reforms were won and new laws passed. But counter-revolution and reaction asserted itself: From slavery to Jim Crow, from lynch rope to drug wars, mass incarceration, wanton police murder of black lives, and state violence.  &#10;&#10;Major victories of the past left intact the economic and political system of global capitalism. Historic inequalities and oppressions rooted in realities of race, nationality, and gender evolved within the class relations of capitalism. Race and class are deeply intertwined in shaping the economic, political, and social relations. As the economic system develops, these disparities and injustices are exacerbated, and are driven by the deep structural changes in the nature of work, the relations between labour and corporations (capital), and the state.  &#10;&#10;In the current moment economic and political polarisation is intensifying. It is highly racialised, impacting blacks disproportionately; and given the history of white supremacy it could not be otherwise.  &#10;&#10;The technological revolution at the foundation of the economy - the development of computers, digitisation, automation, and robots - dates from the 1950s. It took off in the 1980s and is in high gear in the twenty-first century. It is radically transforming every aspect of the economy, including production, distribution, communication, knowledge and culture, and impacts our daily lives in ways never imagined. The economy shifted from a machine- based system that enhanced workers' productivity to an electronic-based system that is labour-replacing and increasingly displaces workers, but is ever more productive and cheaper with robotic labour. Everything changes – globalisation, wealth, work, wages, war, and the state.  &#10;&#10;Numbers tell the story of these stark realities. In a world where the 85 richest people owned $110 trillion in wealth, equal to that of the poorest 3.5 billion people combined in 2013, the United States is the most unequal. Here, in the aftermath of the Great Recession, the top 1 percent earned 95 percent of total income gains since 2009, compared to the bottom 99 percent who earned a meager 5 percent of gains. Race matters, of course. Black median household income was $35,416 in 2014, less than 60 percent of white income at $59,754.  &#10;&#10;Unemployment in 2014 inched below 6 percent, but was still 9.6 million workers. This doubled if the 2.1 million discouraged workers and the 7.3 million part-time workers wanting full-time work were added. Again, black unemployment at 11.4 percent was double that of whites at 5.3.  &#10;&#10;The new electronic economy renders huge swaths of US and global workers disposable, and thus “dangerous” to the system that has discarded them. Over the last fifty years there have been profound changes in state policies and practices to manage and contain this new reality.  &#10;&#10;From safety net to neoliberalism and austerity. From welfare state to warfare state. From civil rights to incarceration and deportation nation. The militarisation of the police, state violence, and corporate control of the state are escalating.  &#10;&#10;Again race matters. A white police officer has killed a black person about two times a week from 2006 to 2012. Since 1997, the Department of Defense has given $5.1bn in equipment to state and local police departments. Homeland Security has made grants worth $41bn since 2002. And the Pentagon, beginning in 2006, has given local police departments $1.9bn of equipment - including 600 mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicles (MRAPs), 80,000 assault rifles, 200 grenade launchers, and 12,000 bayonets.  &#10;&#10;The state directs and protects the US and global economy in the interests of a tiny class of corporate billionaires who have bought control of local and national governments and international financial institutions, and wage war at home and abroad to maintain their wealth and power.  &#10;&#10;No one believes Ferguson is an isolated incident. But, to make the leap in our understanding that it represents systemic state violence that demands fundamental reorganisation of power and the economy requires political education connected to political struggle. Our vision and our strategy for the emerging movement have to move along the path to a new society that is cooperative and egalitarian, and organised to satisfy human needs and protect the earth.  	Ferguson sparks rebellion across the US to resist growing poverty, white&#10;supremacy, and militarised police state.&#10;&#10;

(AP)  &#10;&#10;Sixty-six years ago was the high water mark of global disapproval of xenophobia, and racial and religious discrimination. On December 10, 1948, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and then gave Eleanor Roosevelt a standing ovation for her leading role. Today, this statement of principle would never pass.  &#10;&#10;Racial and religious discrimination is the trademark of the U.N. itself.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Let\'s look back at the year 2014.  &#10;&#10;At least another 75,000 people were butchered in Syria. There were violent crackdowns in Hong Kong, bloody takeovers in Ukraine, subjugation of women in Saudi Arabia, brutal lawlessness in Yemen, Libya, Nigeria, Mexico – and so on.  &#10;&#10;But at the United Nations, 2014 wraps up with the adoption of twenty times more resolutions by the General Assembly condemning the state of Israel for violating human rights than any other nation on earth.  &#10;&#10;There is not one General Assembly resolution worried about human rights in China or Russia or Saudi Arabia or Yemen or Libya or Nigeria or Mexico – and so forth.  &#10;&#10;The General Assembly will even adopt one resolution critical of Syria but two resolutions demanding Israel immediately return the Golan Heights to Syria – the place where lucky Syrians and UN peacekeepers dash to Israel for protection. The demonization of Israel, and the inequality of the self- determination of the Jewish people, by way of the United Nations have one painfully obvious purpose: the end of the Jewish state. Eleanor Roosevelt would have called it a gross violation of the very spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  &#10;&#10;If you walk into the newly-renovated UN, which opened its doors in the fall after a $2 billion dollar spending spree (a quarter of which came from American taxpayers), the first stop on the public tour straight off the elevator is an exhibit on Palestinian rights.  &#10;&#10;It’s a fictional narrative of “11 million Palestinians” and the story of generation after generation of “refugees” from successive wars that spontaneously “broke out.” The only “contraventions of international law” are by Israel. Palestinians have justifiable “uprisings.” Israelis have “extremists.” Arabs mount “peace initiatives.” Israelis mount “military operations.”  &#10;&#10;The kicker: Palestinian history miraculously mirrors Jewish history and begins in 1948 with an “exodus” after “the catastrophe” of the establishment of Israel.  &#10;&#10;If our nation is seriously worried about incitement to racial and religious intolerance, it is time to get serious about incitement at the UN.  &#10;&#10;On November 24, 2014, the U.N. held its annual International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. It marked the anniversary of the 1948 General Assembly resolution partitioning Palestine into an Arab and a Jewish state by flying only the flag of the “State of Palestine” and banning the flag of Israel.  &#10;&#10;For the past two weeks, the public entrance to U.N. headquarters has been decorated with another exhibit. “The Long Journey” purports to tell the history of the Palestinian “exodus” that began in 1948 – not 1967. Photos show Palestinians studying, eating, praying, training, cooking, shopping, dancing, sewing, and playing. Never killing. Never terrorizing. Never making war. Never spouting anti-Semitism. But suffering with “ingenuity, resilience and steadfastness” from wanton Israeli aggression.  &#10;&#10;At the U.N. in Geneva there has been another public exhibit gracing the U.N.’s Palais des Nations. It is entitled “La Nakba: Exode et Expulsion des Palestiniens en 1948” – meaning “The Nakba: Exodus and Expulsion of the Palestinians in 1948.” The exhibit, which was a “cultural activity” requested by “Palestine,” required UN approval and facilitation. According to formal guidelines, it must have been approved at the highest levels – the Director- General, Michael Møller of Denmark.  &#10;&#10;It includes the following astounding statements: “The Palestinians failed to see why they should be made to pay for the Holocaust…Acts of terrorism…by the Zionists led to the flight and expulsion of the native Arab Palestinian population….Zionist representatives…planned and implemented the ethnic purge.” “The partition resolution violates fundamental principles of the UN Charter.”  &#10;&#10;The organizers shamelessly responded in a written handout to the rhetorical question: “Why did we create this exhibition on the Nakba?” Their answer: to reeducate those misinformed by “German guilt” and “the mass media” in order to appreciate that in 1948, Palestinians were “robbed of their homeland and their property.”  &#10;&#10;Hiding in plain sight at the UN is the reason for the lack of peace between Israelis and Arabs – and it has nothing to do with 1967 and “occupation.” For Palestinians and Arabs across the Middle East, Israel is one big settlement.  &#10;&#10;As Palestinian representative Riyad Mansour openly told his U.N. audience on November 24, 2014: “Our people are suffering immense and growing hardships, all stemming from the grave injustice done to them in Al-Nakba of 1948 and thereafter.”  &#10;&#10;The month of November saw six full days at U.N. headquarters dedicated to dehumanizing Israelis, led by speakers from UNRWA, the Palestinian Authority and Iran. Israel was guilty of “an onslaught,” “ethnic cleansing,” “an inhumane blockade,” “torture,” “massacring civilians with a vengeance,” “virulent racism,” “barbarism,” “a policy of terrorism,” “genocide,” “apartheid,” “savagery,” “terror rampages,” “horrific abuse,” “supporting Al Qaeda,” “heinous crimes,” “beating and torturing juveniles,” and “crimes against humanity.”  &#10;&#10;That was in addition, to repeating “Zionism is racism” and analogizing Israelis to Nazis. Lebanon, for instance, said: “From 1948 until today, many Palestinian young girls and boys are just as determined as Anne Frank to conquer their fear of the occupier…”  &#10;&#10;How many more stabbings, rapes, and killings of Jews around the globe will it take to end American tolerance for incitement to racial and religious intolerance at the United Nations?  &#10;&#10;Eleanor Roosevelt would have had an answer.  	Sixty-six years ago was the high water mark of global disapproval of&#10;xenophobia, and racial and religious discrimination. On December 10, 1948, the&#10;UN General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and then&#10;gave Eleanor Roosevelt a standing ovation for her leading role. Today, this&#10;statement of principle would never pass.&#10;&#10;

The streets of major US cities are not filled with anti-war demonstrations, yet the apparent quiet does not signify consent. A look at history shows why.  &#10;&#10;The US has been attacked on domestic territory twice in the past century. On December 7, 1941, the Empire of Japan bombed Pearl Harbour, killing 2,403 Americans and wounding 1,178 others. The next day, US Congress voted to declare war on Japan, thus committing to active hostilities in World War II. That declaration of war has since proved to be the last in the history of the US.  &#10;&#10;The next and last mass scale violent attack by an outside aggressor on the domestic territory of the US occurred 13 years ago, on September 11, 2001, with the immediate death toll approaching 3,000. Three days later, Congress adopted an Authorisation for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) against those held responsible for the September 11 attacks. In so doing, Congress delegated war-making powers to President George W Bush under the terms of the War Powers Act of 1973.  &#10;&#10;December 7 and September 11 are notable in part because in both cases horrendous violence against the people of the US was responded to with an act of Congress. Oppose or support US entry into either of those wars, question or affirm that those wars were lawful, there was no question in either case that Congress had signed off on them.  &#10;&#10;Congressional approval  &#10;&#10;It mattered that Congress approve, because Article I, Section 8 of the US Constitution accords primary war powers, including the power to commence and end war, to Congress alone. For a president of the US to make war without congressional approval was an unthinkable act that would have threatened the legitimacy of the federal government.  &#10;&#10;With his war on the so-called Islamic State, US President Barack Obama has committed that unthinkable act, and Congress has let him. And yet, by all appearances, no one outside of a handful of members of Congress, legal scholars, and peace activists has spoken out in protest.  &#10;&#10;Contrast this moment with that of the weeks and months following September 11. On September 29, 2001, upwards of 25,000 people marched through Washington, DC, against the impending invasion of Afghanistan; tens of thousands demonstrated elsewhere throughout the US. By April 20, 2002, the anti-war protest in Washington drew over 150,000. By February 15, national protest turnout hit 2 million.  &#10;&#10;Given this history, one cannot conclude that the size and volume of anti-war protests directly resulted from the relative popularity of a particular war. After all, the 2001-2003 protests erupted and swelled over a period in which polls showed continued strong support among the US public for Washington's war operations. And in fact, as in 2003-2008 public opinion turned against the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, the size and volume of anti-war movement went down.  &#10;&#10;The simple and correct explanation for this history is that anti-war organisers made decisions in 2001, 2002, and 2003, to focus their energies on mobilising street protests, and that in the years 2004-2008, as anti-war sentiment was taken up by a majority of the American people, many anti-war organisers shifted much of their focus to electing anti-war candidates to office.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;What has changed since Obama assumed the presidency? In Washington, in terms of war and security, very little. Guantanamo remains in operation. The police state has expanded. Assassination and missile strikes have increased. Border militarisation and deportations have escalated. And US military operations have continued and spread further across the globe.  &#10;&#10;Having lived and struggled through this history, why would anti-war organisers choose to respond to Washington's undeclared, unauthorised war against the so- called Islamic State by mobilising street protests? Why would they mobilise to elect anti-war candidates?  &#10;&#10;The core of the peace movement remains active in many parts of the US. Every day I receive notices about civil disobedience at military bases, hunger strikes, local government resolutions calling for a shift in spending priorities away from the military, and much more.  &#10;&#10;For this reason, the relative silence of anti-war organisers in the face of the war against the so-called Islamic State stands out as a warning to the Washington establishment; those who oppose their policies question whether Congress and the presidency can provide effective redress for the grievances of the American people. Washington should fear the silence of the US anti-war movement, for it is full of sound and fury and signifies everything.  	US cities are not filled with anti-war demonstrations, yet the apparent quiet&#10;does not signify consent.&#10;&#10;
269-useconomywhyimoptimisticaboutg	foxnews	2014-12-30T13:00:14Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/12/30/us-economy-why-im-optimistic-about-growth-in-2015/	Stephen Moore	US economy: Why I'm optimistic about growth in 2015	  &#10;&#10;Could 2015 be the breakout year for the economy?  &#10;&#10;Last week we got very joyful news:  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;All of this is good news as we ring in the new year. And the best may be yet to come.  &#10;&#10;So why is the economy finally shifting into a higher gear? This isn\'t a story of government-directed growth or stimulus spending. It’s the opposite: Washington’s role in the economy is starting to shrink after years of Obama administration activism. The private sector is starting to take over.  &#10;&#10;The growth was propelled by a big rise in business investment, up nearly 9 percent; personal consumption, up 3.2 percent; and exports, up 4.5 percent.  &#10;&#10;Government spending, which is a negative for the economy, grew by 4.4 percent, thanks to a big rise in military spending, but domestic spending is still restrained.  &#10;&#10;The news was so good that even the threat that the Fed will now have an excuse to raise interest rates hasn’t deterred the bulls on Wall Street.  &#10;&#10;Here is the case for optimism going forward.  &#10;&#10;First, a huge factor in the economic rebound has been the fall in energy costs. As the price of oil has fallen from $105 a barrel this summer to closer $70 by September, (and at the end of December it was at $53) the cost of oil imports has tumbled. Imports fell by nearly 2 percent, and this alone added almost 0.2 percentage points to GDP growth.  &#10;&#10;Even that greatly understates the economic windfall from cheap energy. Production costs fall when energy costs do, so the supply of American-produced non-oil and gas products, such as manufactured goods, rises when gas is cheap. Gas prices should continue to fall, the good-news story rolls on, and the addition to GDP from energy should be even higher. Thank you, Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota. And thank you, fracking.  &#10;&#10;Second, businesses are clearly feeling less trepidation about investing, and some of the wet blanket of Obama\'s anti-business, anti-shareholder agenda has dissipated as the Republican Congress repels his worst ideas: cap-and-trade, minimum wage hikes, new taxes on the energy industry and massive new spending initiatives out of Washington. Gridlock now looks to be built into the political system for the next two years, and in many ways that\'s reassuring.  &#10;&#10;Third, government spending has fallen a lot more than people think.Despite the boost in military spending in the last quarter, the biggest story of the U.S. economy over the last three years has been the retrenchment of government spending.  &#10;&#10;Federal spending has fallen from 24.4 percent of GDP in 2009 and 23.4 percent of GDP in 2010 to 21 percent of GDP in 2014. Even better news is that in the fourth quarter of 2014, federal spending as a share of GDP fell to below 20 percent, according to a new analysis by Dan Clifton of Strategas, an economic policy consulting firm. This is creating an anti-Keynesian boost to growth, because the government is taking fewer private sector resources each month.  &#10;&#10;The 4 percentage points less of GDP that the government is spending means 4 percent more GDP for private businesses and families to spend. That’s close to $700 billion a year more for private investment and construction and spending.  &#10;&#10;This, by the way, shows the foolhardiness of the Keynesian notion of a government-spending free lunch. Five years ago the Obama economics team was talking about multiplier effects from higher federal outlays — the stimulus bill spent $830 billion — that would juice the economy with even more private spending.  &#10;&#10;It never happened. Even President Obama’s own economic analysis found the economy grew more slowly than it would have without the government debt- financed spending. The real effect of government spending is to crowd out private spending.  &#10;&#10;A final reason for optimism is that the incoming class of Republican governors and conservative state legislators across the country should mean more growth policies coming out of state capitals. At least a dozen governors from Massachusetts to Illinois to Tennessee are talking about tax cuts to create jobs. So even if we don’t get tax reform at the federal level, states should be providing an additional tax cut stimulus.  &#10;&#10;Skeptics will say that Obama’s executive actions on climate change, immigration, energy policy and so on will continue to be a restraint on growth. That’s for sure.  &#10;&#10;This recovery from recession is still nearly $2 trillion behind where we should would be if we had a Reagan-paced boom. This is still one of the most anemic recoveries, though it is belatedly picking up steam.  &#10;&#10;It’s also true that wages are still flat for most workers, so the big challenge for the economy is raising productivity so Americans get a well- deserved pay raise.  &#10;&#10;As 2014 comes to a close, here’s where we are: Interest rates are as low as they’ve been in 40 years; inflation is tame, thanks to the surge in oil and gas output; and corporate profits remain high.  &#10;&#10;The rest of the world economy, from Germany to Japan to Russia, is a debacle. But that’s all the more reason to bet on the USA in 2015.  &#10;&#10;And, no, Mr. President, you didn’t build that.  	Could 2015 be the breakout year for the economy?&#10;&#10;

In early January, the recent terrorist attacks in Paris against the Charlie Hebdo magazine and a kosher supermarket gave us a glimpse of what the future of terrorism looks like, and what the civilized world will have to defend against.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;At the same time, the unfolding chaos in Yemen and loss of a U.S. partner in the fight against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) raises serious concerns about the future of a country that four months ago President Obama cited as a successful model for U.S.-led efforts to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).  &#10;&#10;ISIL and AQAP are two faces of the same enemy, radical violent Islam, which is on the march around the world.  &#10;&#10;In 2013, ISIL was confined to Syria and Iraq. As the Syria civil war dragged on, and in the absence of early, forceful intervention on the part of the United States or European nations, the chaotic situation spread to Iraq, where weak security services were no match for an emboldened terrorist army.  &#10;&#10;In 2014, global support to the Islamic State blossomed as it began to supplant likeminded terrorist groups, and the Islamic State counted affiliates in Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Saudi Arabia. ISIL even has begun to make inroads in Yemen, where the United States has been involved in efforts to degrade AQAP\'s capabilities, but have been unable to eliminate AQAP\'s ability to conduct attacks on us and our allies. AQAP remains one of the most pressing security threats America currently faces as the recent attacks in Paris show. In the wake of the Paris attacks and plots disrupted elsewhere in Europe, European capitals are rightfully defiant in the face of terror. But without a change in our strategy, the task of defending against the triple threat of home grown extremism, jihadists who have easy access to hotbeds of radicalization in places like Yemen and Syria, and the expansion of the Islamic State, will be nearly impossible. The Islamic State continues to recruit extremists in Europe, the Middle East, and as far away as southeast Asia, using targeted, high quality videos, magazines and literature copied in several languages to spread their message around the world. They trumpet their successes on the battlefield, and try to portray a welcoming environment centered on family and Islam as a means to attract terrorists and their families as subjects of their caliphate.  &#10;&#10;The United States and all civilized countries need to coordinate our efforts to fight the Islamic State first by cutting them off. We must counter their message on social media; bolster allies like Iraq and Jordan; and ensure that we prevent suspected terrorists from traveling back and forth between their homelands and places like Syria, Libya, and Yemen. Perhaps most importantly, we have to help governments eliminate the safe havens that the Islamic State relies on to gather strength. Syria, Yemen, and Libya are all examples of our failure to learn one of the fundamental lessons of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 -- that failed and failing states breed instability and are potential safe havens for terrorists who will eventually turn their attention toward us. We also cannot afford to ignore another lesson of 9/11 and curtail intelligence gathering capabilities that have been legally and painstakingly established following those horrific attacks.  &#10;&#10;The U.S. government should implore American technology companies to cooperate with authorities so that we can better track terrorist activity and monitor terrorist communications as we face the increasing challenge of homegrown terrorists radicalized by little more than what they see on the Internet.  &#10;&#10;This year, a new Republican majority in both houses of Congress will have to extend current authorities under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and I urge my colleagues to consider a permanent extension of the counterterrorism tools our intelligence community relies on to keep the American people safe. The challenge we face as free societies is unlike anything we have seen in recent decades. As we look at this moment in the long war against terrorism, it is encouraging to see Europeans aggressively moving to defend the continent following a horrific attack. But one need look no further than the setbacks in Yemen and the stalemate in Syria and Iraq to see the limitations of President Obama\'s current strategy. Lofty speeches and half measures do not defeat terrorist groups. They also do not keep Americans safe in the long term. The threat from Islamic extremism is only growing and without greater leadership from the United States, I fear that it will only be a matter of time before innocent Americans pay the ultimate price if we continue to underestimate our enemies and not develop a strategy that is commensurate to the threat.  &#10;&#10;Republican Marco Rubio represents Florida in the U.S. Senate. He is a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.

We all know who it is.  &#10;&#10;And, frankly, most of us French people would have preferred to have President Obama or any other senior U.S. government official rather than Ahmed Davutoglu, the Turkish Prime Minister, or Victor Orban, his Hungarian counterpart, or Sergei Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister – those hypocrites whose conception of "freedom of expression" is not exactly that of Voltaire.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;There is no good excuse for the U.S. physical absence (apart from the presence of Ambassador Jane Hartley, whose face is unknown to 99.99% of the French population) from last Sunday’s march.  &#10;&#10;Perhaps the White House did not realize that it would be a historical event? But for most world leaders, the decision to be present in Paris was a last minute decision.  &#10;&#10;It would not not have been easy for the U.S. Secret Service to improvise the appropriate security measures? Well, if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could do it, don’t tell us that Obama could not.  &#10;&#10;Maybe the president was not available ? Then Vice President Joe Biden could have altered whatever plans he had for Sunday. (Secretary of State John Kerry was in India and Indians don’t like being snubbed.)  &#10;&#10;Perhaps the president did not want to support the Charlie Hebdo people because he believes that "the future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam" (his words at the U.N. General Assembly in 2012)? Not a good excuse – this was not about approving what the French cartoonists were doing, but showing solidarity in the face of terrorism.  &#10;&#10;Obama missed an opportunity to present himself as the leader of the free world in front of the continued menace of jihadi terrorism; but that is his loss. The mere fact that his presence was apparently not even discussed in the the White House is a confirmation that this administration does not feel as close to Europe as others did in the past; but we knew that already.  &#10;&#10;At the end of the day, I’m not sure that it really matters to us French in the current context. The debate after the march about Obama’s absence became a debate in France only because it was one in the United States. Some in the French government have whispered that Obama’s presence would have relegated President Hollande to the shadows.  &#10;&#10;But most importantly, we received such an outpouring of sympathy from our American friends, Democrats and Republicans alike, that we know the United States could feel our pain. Just as we felt America’s pain after 9/11.  &#10;&#10;In addition, there is absolutely no doubt that US-French cooperation on counterterrorism, which was already excellent, will be tightened even more. Immediately after the attacks, Washington offered support from its intelligence services. The White House has announced that it will convene a Summit on Counter-Extremism in February – that will be an opportunity to devise common strategies. And you know what ? Maybe the U.S. administration’s biggest problem is that we discovered its embarrassing absence only after the fact.  	We received such an outpouring of sympathy from our American friends,&#10;Democrats and Republicans alike, that we know the United States could feel our&#10;pain. Just as we felt America’s pain after 9/11.&#10;&#10;

The woman and child were recorded in the immediate aftermath of an aerial bombing raid in 1972, one of Portugal's many responses to the Mozambican desire for liberation.  &#10;&#10;In typical fashion, the Portuguese and their imperial colleagues instead portrayed the Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO) as violent terrorists, despite the merely reactive nature of anti-colonial violence to centuries of oppression.  &#10;&#10;After all, violence is the prerogative of empire.  &#10;&#10;Among Fanon's sober assessments is that colonialism "is violence in its natural state, and it will only yield when confronted with greater violence". Decolonisation, he writes, "is always a violent phenomenon". "Decolonisation, which sets out to change the order of the world, is, obviously, a programme of complete disorder".  &#10;&#10;The film corroborates these assertions with footage from former European colonial possessions in Africa. Scenes variously depict the subjugation and impoverishment of native populations, juxtaposed with Europeans sun-tanning and playing golf in picturesque African settings in between wantonly extracting resources and imprisoning and torturing people.  &#10;&#10;This, in turn, provides the proper context for scenes of militant African resistance.  &#10;&#10;Particularly illustrative of the prevailing "order of the world" is an interview with a white settler in then-Rhodesia who addresses his black servant boy as "you stupid thing, you" and laments the impending African reclamation of the territory: "The gooks have got it."  &#10;&#10;When asked by the interviewer to clarify his derogatory slang, he elaborates with more slang: "The terrs… The whole world is supporting the terrorists."  &#10;&#10;To be sure, we've superficially done away with the whole colonialism business, it being generally understood that colonies are bad and archaic things. There are, however, notable exceptions to the rule, as in the case of state of Israel, which is granted a de facto exemption from ceasing colonial operations and is furthermore regularly lauded as a beacon of democracy.  &#10;&#10;But the same oppressive structures that underpinned colonialism continue to flourish in the age of neoliberal globalisation, which functions according to the idea that there is a class of human beings - often but not always determined by skin colour - entitled to a level of wealth and comfort that is only attainable by depriving the global masses of a dignified existence.  &#10;&#10;And as always, a violent apparatus is required to secure the arrangement.  &#10;&#10;In recent years, the African continent has witnessed an ever-amplified US military presence. Writing in Jacobin magazine, David Mizner describes the scenario as a "soft occupation correspond[ing] with a battle between China and the [US] over the spoils of Africa, which has massive natural resources and six of the world's fastest growing economies".  &#10;&#10;Poor Africans might be forgiven for failing to detect enormous differences between this and previous intrusions from abroad.  &#10;&#10;In other parts of the world that the US prefers to think of as its own personal military base - such as Central America - the imperial power has backed the security forces of various repressive and illegitimate leaders committed to violently squelching popular protest.  &#10;&#10;Reasons for protest have included government insistence on catering to foreign corporations rather than to indigenous and peasant communities opposed to the usurpation and contamination of their lands by mining operations and the like.  &#10;&#10;But the victims are largely invisible, the dehumanised refuse of empire and the price to be paid for securing corporate profit.  &#10;&#10;In her spoken preface to Concerning Violence, renowned Columbia University professor Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak explains that in "reading between the lines" of The Wretched of the Earth, one sees that Fanon does not in fact endorse violence but rather "insists that the tragedy is that the very poor is reduced to violence, because there is no other response possible to an absolute absence of response and an absolute exercise of legitimised violence from the colonisers".  &#10;&#10;Spivak goes on to make a telling comparison regarding the earth's "wretched": "Their lives count as nothing against the death of the colonisers: unacknowledged Hiroshimas against sentimentalised 9/11s."  &#10;&#10;For another modern-day example of legitimised violence and self-victimisation by the very purveyors of said violence, it seems appropriate to once again bring up the state of Israel, which shares the ex-Rhodesian resident's knack for hallucinating himself into a position of unparalleled suffering at the hands of "terrorists".  &#10;&#10;Following last month's Jerusalem synagogue attack in which two Palestinians murdered five Israelis, there was a typical upsurge in terror-hysteria from the Israeli establishment and sympathetic governments and media. Studiously ignored were the various Israeli crimes that directly preceded the event, not to mention this summer's slaughter of more than 2,100 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.  &#10;&#10;Meanwhile, Israel's primary benefactor - the nation described by Fanon as the "former European colony [that] decided to catch up with Europe" - should find much to reflect on in Concerning Violence, particularly given Fanon's conclusion regarding the European experiment: "It succeeded so well that the United States of America became a monster, in which the taints, the sickness, and the inhumanity of Europe have grown to appalling dimensions."  &#10;&#10;Contemporary manifestations of the American sickness include the recent decision by a Missouri grand jury not to indict a police officer for killing an unarmed black teenager in the city of Ferguson - far from an isolated instance of fatal bigotry.  &#10;&#10;Drawing on several of Fanon's texts, journalist Roqayah Chamseddine penned an essay on the aftermath of the Ferguson decision for Al-Akhbar English, in which she condemned the liberal American tradition of placing the onus of non- violence on those oppressed by the state rather than the state itself - an entity that engages in "unfettered police brutality and judicial discrimination" against black communities.  &#10;&#10;This tradition entails an obsession with containing potentially "violent" black reactions to state violence (eg vandalism and looting), and ultimately prescribes a superior concern for private property and material goods than for black life. Chamseddine writes: "Today in the United States many will be grieving for buildings burned and windows broken, while the bourgeoisie will cry out 'calm!' and hurriedly search for Martin Luther King Jr quotes to guilt black protesters into supporting their deadly liberal pacifism."  &#10;&#10;Suffice it to say Concerning Violence should concern us all.  	A new documentary on colonial legacies in Africa raises questions about the&#10;colonialisms of today.&#10;&#10;
273-vladimirputinauschwitzmemorial	guardian	2015-01-20T19:30:23Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/20/vladimir-putin-auschwitz-memorial-ceremony-soviet-union-liberating-camps	Antony Beevor	Why Vladimir Putin should be at the Auschwitz memorial ceremony	On 27 January 1945 a reconnaissance patrol from the Soviet 107th Rifle Division emerged from the snow-laden forest 70km west of Kraków. The soldiers were mounted on shaggy ponies, their submachine guns slung across their backs. In front of them stood Auschwitz-Birkenau, the grimmest symbol of modern history. Officers gazed around in disbelief, then called in medical teams to care for the 3,000 sick prisoners left behind.  &#10;&#10;It is a great shame that Vladimir Putin, having not been invited, won’t be present at a memorial ceremony next week to mark the 70th anniversary – at the very least, it would have reminded the world that the advance of Stalin’s Red Army forced the SS to abandon the extermination camps in the east. And yet the muted row over the Russian president’s absence is a reminder that this particular chapter in Russia’s second world war history was, and remains, full of contradictions.  &#10;&#10;. The first death camp to be liberated by the Red Army was Majdanek just outside Lublin, in July 1944. The novelist and war correspondent Vasily Grossman was on the spot with the 8th Guards Army, which had defended Stalingrad, but an order came down that he was not to cover the story. The job was given instead to Konstantin Simonov, a favourite of the regime, who managed to avoid mentioning that any of the victims in Majdanek were Jewish.  &#10;&#10;Grossman, despite warnings from his friend Ilya Ehrenburg, had been slow to believe that antisemitism could exist within the Soviet hierarchy during the death struggle with Nazism. But in 1943 he had noticed that any reference to Jewish suffering was being cut from his articles. He wrote to complain to Aleksandr Shcherbakov, the chief of the Red Army political department. Shcherbakov replied: “The soldiers want to hear about [Russian military hero of the Napoleonic era] Suvorov, but you quote [German 19th-century poet] Heine”. Grossman joined Ehrenburg on the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee to chronicle Nazi crimes, unaware of how dangerous this might prove to be. Several of their colleagues were murdered by the secret police.  &#10;&#10;Certain truths about the Shoah could never be published. When Grossman wrote about the extermination camp of Treblinka, he could not reveal that the auxiliary guards were mostly Ukrainian. Collaboration with the enemy was a taboo subject since it undermined the rhetoric of the Great Patriotic War.  &#10;&#10;As the end of the war approached, controls became even stricter. Auschwitz may have been liberated at the end of January 1945, but no details were released until the final victory in May. The Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee soon found that its work was in direct opposition to the party instruction: “Do not divide the dead!” Jews were not to be seen as a special category of suffering. They were to be described only as citizens of the USSR and Poland. Thus in a way Stalin was the first Holocaust denier, even if his antisemitism was not quite the same as that of the Nazis. It was probably based more on a xenophobic suspicion of international connections than on racial hatred.  &#10;&#10;Soviet propaganda, while designating those killed at Auschwitz in collectively anonymous terms as “victims of fascism”, also portrayed the extermination camp as the ultimate capitalist factory, where the workers were murdered when no longer useful.  &#10;&#10;And there was a further twist away from the truth. The Stalinists emphasised how many Poles had died there to distract attention from their own crimes against the Polish people, both following the Red Army’s unprovoked invasion in 1939 under the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, and its brutal occupation from 1944. They portrayed Auschwitz as the place of martyrdom for the Polish nation. By talking only of the Polish Catholics who had died there, they hoped that the Poles might focus any anger at their bitter fate entirely against Germany and not against the Soviet Union.  &#10;&#10;Few Poles were taken in during those postwar years of Soviet oppression. And now Putin’s ill-disguised attempts to reassert Russian control over Ukraine have of course reminded the Polish people all too clearly of what Soviet “liberation” meant for them in 1945. It is not therefore surprising that we should be seeing a certain amount of diplomatic shadow-boxing in the background, while both sides insist everything is normal. The Kremlin is pretending not to have been snubbed by the fact that President Putin has not been asked to the commemoration event; meanwhile, the Polish government insists it was not issuing formal invitations. The Auschwitz international committee, which includes a Russian representative, was simply asking each government who would be representing them.  &#10;&#10;Putin made a speech at Auschwitz 10 years ago on the 60th anniversary, and no doubt he will again proclaim in Moscow on 9 May – Russia’s Victory Day – that the Red Army’s defeat of “the fascist beast” saved Europe from Nazi slavery. But those countries, especially Poland and the Baltic states, that experienced the ensuing 40 years of Communist dictatorship glance nervously east once more. Russia, obsessed for centuries by a fear of encirclement and surprise attack, has always felt justified in dominating its “near abroad”. It was Stalin’s shock at Hitler’s invasion in 1941, and his consequent determination to create a defensive cordon, that led to the cold war. Putin, fortunately, is a very pale imitation of his hero.  &#10;&#10;• Antony Beevor’s next book, Ardennes – 1944: Hitler’s Last Gamble, is out in May  	Antony Beevor: We should forget neither the Soviet Union’s role in liberating the camps, nor its antisemitic blind spots
274-voluntaryeuthanasianotoptionfr	guardian	2015-01-06T20:15:35Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/06/voluntary-euthanasia-not-option-frank-van-den-bleeken	Quassim Cassam	When should voluntary euthanasia not be an option?	This week a court in Belgium announced that the convicted rapist and murderer Frank Van Den Bleeken would be put to death by a lethal injection, in spite of the fact that the death penalty is banned across Europe. Van Den Bleeken’s case was unusual: having previously been declared insane and not criminally responsible, he had himself asked to be euthanised on the grounds that he would rather die than spend the rest of his life in jail.  &#10;&#10;Today the Belgian justice minister announced that Van Den Bleeken would not be euthanised after all, amid reports that the prisoner had changed his mind. Nonetheless, the case provides a fascinating twist to the old debate about euthanasia. Should Van Den Bleeken have been allowed to die?  &#10;&#10;The moral defence of voluntary euthanasia is usually applied to people suffering from a terminal illness. But Van Den Bleeken isn’t terminally ill and isn’t in physical pain. Another traditional requirement is that the wish to die should be voluntary and competent. But how can the choices of someone who has been declared insane be regarded as voluntary and competent? The concern is that granting his request would make it a case of involuntary euthanasia, and that is usually seen as morally unacceptable.  &#10;&#10;If there is an issue about Van Bleeken’s sanity that is because of his alleged inability to control his sexual impulses. But it could be argued that this doesn’t affect the validity of his request to be euthanised. The implication is that while some of his decisions might be involuntary or incompetent, this doesn’t apply to his choice of death over a lifetime behind bars.  &#10;&#10;Even so, should his request have been granted, given that he isn’t terminally ill? One argument for allowing voluntary euthanasia where terminal illness isn’t an issue turns on the idea of wellbeing: people should be allowed to choose death where they would literally be better off dead or where their life literally isn’t worth living. Another argument turns on human autonomy: we should respect a person’s free choices as long as they don’t harm anyone else. Someone who is not terminally ill could still satisfy these requirements. Had Van Den Bleeken been allowed to die, critics may say it would have risked opening the floodgates for other similar cases. Belgium has seen a dramatic rise in euthanasia since the practice was legalised in 2002 and permitted in cases of pain and psychological distress, as well as terminal illness.  &#10;&#10;Some are opposed to voluntary euthanasia as a matter of principle. The philosopher David Velleman argues that there isn’t a fundamental right to choose between life and death, and that a person’s rights don’t expand when they become terminally ill or psychologically distressed. He is heavily influenced by 18th century philosopher Immanuel Kant. According to Kant, morality requires that we respect the dignity of persons, and the dignity of persons makes them intrinsically valuable. For Kant, a person’s dignity can’t be traded against their wellbeing or happiness, and the fact that a person believes that their life isn’t worth living doesn’t make it acceptable for them to be euthanised.  &#10;&#10;The Van Den Bleeken case puts pressure on these standard arguments for and against voluntary euthanasia. Suppose that, contrary to Kant’s view, voluntary euthanasia is morally permissible as long as the person asking to be euthanised would be genuinely better off dead. Relatives of Van Den Bleeken’s victim may well argue that the fact (if it is a fact) that he would be better off dead is precisely a reason for not allowing him to be put to death. From this perspective, euthanasia looks like a way for him to circumvent his sentence.  &#10;&#10;Van Den Bleeken’s victim was Christiane Remacle, a 19-year-old he raped and strangled in 1989. Her sisters are reported to have said that Van Den Bleeken should be forced to languish in jail, and their reaction brings out an ambivalence in how we think about the death penalty for murder. Relatives of murder victims often demand the death penalty as the ultimate punishment, but the Van Den Bleeken case suggests that, at least from the standpoint of the perpetrator, the ultimate sanction may be life behind bars.  &#10;&#10;But the intrinsic value argument against voluntary euthanasia can also be hard to swallow, in this case. Christiane Remacle’s sisters might balk at the idea that a murderer’s life is intrinsically valuable. It’s hard not to sympathise, and there remain strong reasons for not allowing Van Den Bleeken to be euthanised regardless of whether his life is intrinsically valuable. As long as euthanasia is seen as a way for him to circumvent his sentence, respect for his victim and her family demands that he isn’t given the option.  	Quassim Cassam: The case of convicted rapist and murderer Frank Van Den Bleeken puts pressure on the standard arguments but for his victim’s sisters, there is only one answer

And for many that means renewed efforts at a fresh start. New Year’s resolutions, we call them. This is the year. It all starts now. We resolve to turn over a new leaf- and this time we’re serious. This time we’re really going to try, we’re not going to quit. We promise ourselves that we’re going to quit bad habits and start good ones. We’re going to get in shape, eat better, be more content, more disciplined, more intentional. We’re going to be better husbands, wives, fathers, mothers. We’re going to work harder, serve more, plan more, give more, read more. We’re going to finally be all that we can be. No more messing around. Well…I say try. Seriously, try.  &#10;&#10;You might make some great strides this year. I’m hoping to. There are a lot of improvements I’m hoping to make over the next 12 months. But don’t be surprised a year from now when you realize that you’ve fallen short…again.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;For those who try and try, year after year, again and again, to get better and better, only to take three steps forward then two steps back, one step forward then three steps back…I have good news for you: you’re in good company! Everybody I have ever talked to sounds just like me over the years. Try and fail. Fail then try. Try and succeed. Succeed then fail. Two steps forward. One step back. One step forward. Three steps back. Every year I get better at some things, worse at others. For example, this past year I’ve become more patient with my children -- more tolerant of their mishaps. Therefore, I’ve been enjoying them more and micromanaging them less (one step forward). But, due to a lack of discipline on my part, I’ve also allowed myself to be stretched too thin this past year and as a result, those I love most have suffered (one step back). Furthermore, no matter how hard I try—no matter how serious I am about resolving to change—I still get frustrated by the same things that frustrated me 20 years ago: traffic jams, unexpected interruptions, long lines, feeling misunderstood, and so on and so forth.  &#10;&#10;You get the idea. In some ways we get better. In some ways we get worse. And in other ways we basically stay the same. Whoever told us that the experience of life was one of escalating progress lied to us. Most of the time it feels rather static, doesn’t it? New Year’s Resolutions are a burdensome attempt to fix ourselves and make ourselves more lovable. But (and here’s the good news), God loves us as we are, not as we should be.  &#10;&#10;God’s love for me, approval of me, and commitment to me does not ride on my resolve but on God’s resolve for me.  &#10;&#10;The good news that gets me through bad times is that God\'s devotion to me is not dependant on my devotion. Knowing that God always meets my messes with his mercy, my failures with his forgiveness, and my guilt with his grace, helps me survive my daily disappointments with me. The Gospel of Jesus Christ is good news to those who\'ve been crushed by unmet expectations of life—it announces that because Jesus won for you, you’re free to lose; because Jesus was strong for you, you’re free to be weak; because Jesus was extraordinary, you’re free to be ordinary; because Jesus succeeded for you, you’re free to fail. So, as this new year gets under way, I’ll still going to try and get better at things, but it’s so much more restful to know that I live my life from love rather than for it. Thank God! Happy New Year!  	New Year's resolutions: Two steps forward. One step back. One step forward.&#10;Three steps back. Every year I get better at some things, worse at others.&#10;&#10;

FILE: Doug Brinson sits on a stoop next to a makeshift memorial for Eric Garner in Staten Island, N.Y. Garner died after he was put in a chokehold by police officers while being arrested at the site for selling untaxed loose cigarettes. His death has been ruled a homicide. (Julie Jacobson/AP)  &#10;&#10;2014 was a year marked by greater division between groups of Americans than I can remember in my adult life.  &#10;&#10;Racial tensions resurfaced in violent protests following the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. New York City’s mayor and police split ranks over the mayor’s comment that his biracial son faced perpetual danger from police officers, followed by the assassination of two New York City police officers.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;The gap in wealth between the richer and poorer segments of Americans widened to record levels.  &#10;&#10;The Democratic and Republican parties became more polarized — with gun rights, immigration, abortion and health insurance leading people not only to argue the issues more vehemently with people from the other party, but to feel like they might have little in common with people from the other party, period.  &#10;&#10;Whether one supports President Obama or not, I believe most people would agree our nation is more divided than it was when he took office.  &#10;&#10;White and black Americans may have thought they were electing a black leader who could unite the country, and that seemed to point to an American future of unity and promise. But something went horribly wrong. To my eye, it was as if the president’s own unhealed wounds were ripping open the wounds of our nation.  &#10;&#10;So it makes me wonder: What do we Americans really have in common, whether black or white, rich or poor, young or old?  &#10;&#10;What should we remember about one another that could bind us together while aggressively arguing the political and social issues that threaten to pull us apart?  &#10;&#10;First, we are all human beings, which means we all suffer. None of us avoids pain, whether from trauma or loss, and just the chapters of our life stories in which we have felt powerless against loved ones falling ill, or falling ill ourselves, should remind us that we are all intensely vulnerable at all times.  &#10;&#10;Our vulnerability means that we owe a duty of care to one another. The universal capacity to hurt is only the flip side of our calling to compassion — which is closely aligned with our capacity to heal.  &#10;&#10;We should, therefore, debate vigorously, but with this in mind: There are very few issues that would keep us on grandstands or podiums or behind television cameras or microphones if, God forbid, we got a call from a doctor with very bad news about our health or — far worse, in my mind — the health of our children. And think about this: How violent would protests be if protesters knew that a few dozen of the police officers standing guard in the streets had sick or disabled kids at home?  &#10;&#10;Second, I believe all human beings are born with the capacity for good. Every single one. No exceptions. And I believe it is a profound tragedy when that capacity is not realized. So think about this: How much more care would we take to try to support parents, even when their children run horribly afoul of the law, if we imagined our own children, broken by forces in their communities or their families or their fragile psyches, paying the price at 17 or 19 and being locked behind bars, alone, for years?  &#10;&#10;The loss of Michael Brown — to the streets, or unwieldy forces in his psyche, or to a bullet — is everyone’s loss.  &#10;&#10;The loss of two New York City police officers — to the twisted rage of a twisted man — is everyone’s loss. And even the suicide of that murderer, who started out as a baby and infant and child with no designs, whatsoever, on the life of another — is everyone’s loss.  &#10;&#10;We are all bleeding, all of the time. This is the human condition.  &#10;&#10;Third, I believe all Americans share the roughly 238-year struggle — still ongoing — for America to realize her greatest self. This struggle, after a War of Independence and through a Civil War and two World Wars and a host of other bloody conflicts inside our boundaries and beyond our boundaries, unites us on a path toward a more perfect union that mirrors every individual’s path toward a more perfect self. This struggle is part of every American’s story, woven into our historical and emotional DNA, and perhaps (scientists now tell us) literally encoded in the amino acids that make up our actual DNA.  &#10;&#10;Yes, we become enraged with one another. Yes, we argue passionately about the future of America. These things are inevitable. They are even necessary when the stakes are freedom and the future. But it might serve us well to remember that if every one of us can grieve and every one of us can suffer and every one of us is mortal and every one of us has the capacity for compassion and every one of us is an inextricable part of this whole we call America, that we are brothers and sisters, as surely as if we shared a single home, the same last name and the same skin.  &#10;&#10;Let the arguments between us be both very loud and, yet, always, quietly loving. I think this much is possible. Because we are more alike than different in our needs and fears, and we have remained much more strangers to one another than we need to be.  &#10;&#10;Dr. Keith Ablow is a psychiatrist and member of the Fox News Medical A-Team.

Israel is recruiting. With the individual and collective trauma of the Paris attacks still fresh, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not lose any time and appealed to the French Jews to leave their home country behind and to emigrate to Israel.  &#10;&#10;While unity was on parade in Paris, Netanyahu brought with him discord and old rifts. The brazenness of his suggestion, uttered in front of French President Francois Hollande, is unrivalled. As is the political opportunism, exploiting a recent tragedy for the purpose of boosting European emigration to a country built on the expulsion and discrimination of the Palestinian population.  &#10;&#10;Such cunning, moreover, falls in line with the staple self-legitimation of Israel through mentions of a less recent disaster, namely the shoah. Zionist ideology dismisses diplomatic protocol and brushes aside any considerations for the human rights of the Palestinian people, all in light of the absolute right that the Israelis purportedly derive from deadly massacres.  &#10;&#10;Perversely, Israel depends upon, lives off, and grows stronger thanks to these tragedies; both past and present. In this sense, it repeats and amplifies the brutalities of these events.  &#10;&#10;The disturbing conclusion, to which we are led by the persistent behaviour of Israeli politicians and by the country's official discourse, is that the State of Israel is symbiotically tied to the atrocities that preceded its establishment and that continue to this day.  &#10;&#10;I doubt that either Netanyahu, or members of his inner circle even realise the full extent of the cynicism in using the murder of French Jews in a kosher supermarket for furthering ideological aims.  &#10;&#10;To them, the tactic does not appear extraordinary at all, because it has been honed, in one form or another, for decades. So much so that Israel may be said to have styled itself as a political phoenix.  &#10;&#10;The phoenix is a mythical bird that, upon burning up, regenerates from the ashes. In my book, Pyropolitics: When the World Is Ablaze, I discussed the dangers inherent in the political version of the phoenix myth;  &#10;&#10;On January 11, 2015, we saw the spectacle replayed in Paris, albeit not in reference to Auschwitz, but with regard to the latest outbursts of anti-Jewish violence. The manipulation of fear and insecurity, experienced by French Jews, reached a high pitch not only in Netanyahu's words but also in a workshop on how to immigrate to Israel, held in Paris on the day of the unity march.  &#10;&#10;Attended by no more than 500 people in a country that is home to half-a-million Jews, the "aliyah fair" represented yet another effort to put terrorist actions to political use in favour of Israel.  &#10;&#10;If, as conservatives claim, fascism and "Islamic extremism" have something in common, it is how they are utilised by Israel to augment its Jewish population at the expense of the diaspora.  &#10;&#10;At the same time, it does not occur to the Israeli political elite that, absent a comprehensive peace with the neighbouring Palestinian state, European Jews will not find the security they are promised in the eastern corner of the Mediterranean.  &#10;&#10;Perpetually at war and on edge, Israel does not come out favourably in comparison with France - even with a France rattled by a series of terrorist attacks; and no alternative parades, like Netanyahu's one-man reverse crusades, will change that.  	While unity was on parade in Paris, Netanyahu brought with him discord and old&#10;rifts.&#10;&#10;

Hundreds of thousands of people marched through Paris on Sunday in a massive show of unity and defiance in the face of terrorism that killed 17 people in France\'s bleakest moment in half a century (AP Photo)  &#10;&#10;The photos of 40 of the world’s government leaders marching arm-in-arm along a Paris boulevard on Sunday with the president of the United States not among them was a provocative image that has fomented much debate. The march was, of course, in direct response to the murderous attacks on workers at the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo by a pair of brothers named Kouachi, and on shoppers at a Paris kosher supermarket by one of the brothers’ comrades.  &#10;&#10;The debate has been about whether President Obama should have been at the march. The march was billed as a defense of freedom of speech in the West; yet it hardly could have been held in a less free speech-friendly Western environment, and the debate over Obama’s absence misses the point.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;In the post-World War II era, French governments have adopted a policy advanced upon them nearly 100 years ago by Woodrow Wilson. He pioneered the modern idea that countries’ constitutions don’t limit governments; they unleash them. Thus, even though the French Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, French governments treat speech as a gift from the government, not as a natural right of all persons, as our Constitution does.  &#10;&#10;The French government has prohibited speech it considers to be hateful and even made it criminal. When the predecessor magazine to Charlie Hebdo once mocked the death of Charles de Gaulle, the French government shut it down -- permanently.  &#10;&#10;The theory of anti-hate speech laws is that hate speech often leads to violence, and violence demands police and thus the expenditure of public resources, and so the government can make it illegal to spout hatred in order to conserve its resources. This attitude presumes, as Wilson did when he prosecuted folks for publicly singing German songs during World War I, that the government is the origin of free speech and can lawfully limit the speech it hates and fears. It also presumes that all ideas are equal, and none is worthy of hatred.  &#10;&#10;When the massacres occurred last week in Paris, all three of the murderers knew that the police would be unarmed and so would be their victims. It was as if they were shooting fish in a barrel.  &#10;&#10;Why is that? The answer lies in the same mentality that believes it can eradicate hate by regulating speech. That mentality demands that government have a monopoly on violence, even violence against evil.  &#10;&#10;So, to those who embrace this dreadful theory, the great loss in Paris last week was not human life, which is a gift from God; it was free speech, which is a gift from the state. Hence the French government, which seems not to care about innocent life, instead of addressing these massacres as crimes against innocent people, proclaimed the massacres crimes against the freedom of speech. Would the French government have reacted similarly if the murderers had killed workers at an ammunition factory, instead of at a satirical magazine?  &#10;&#10;And how hypocritical was it of the French government to claim it defends free speech! In France, you can go to jail if you publicly express hatred for a group whose members may be defined generally by characteristics of birth, such as gender, age, race, place of origin or religion.  &#10;&#10;You can also go to jail for using speech to defy the government. This past weekend, millions of folks in France wore buttons and headbands that proclaimed in French: “I am Charlie Hebdo.” Those whose buttons proclaimed “I am not Charlie Hebdo” were asked by the police to remove them. Those who wore buttons that proclaimed, either satirically or hatefully, “I am Kouachi” were arrested. Arrested for speech at a march in support of free speech? Yes.  &#10;&#10;What’s going on here? What’s going on in France, and what might be the future in America, is the government defending the speech with which it agrees and punishing the speech with which it disagrees. What’s going on is the assault by some in radical Islam not on speech, but on vulnerable innocents in their everyday lives in order to intimidate their governments. What’s going on is the deployment of 90,000 French troops to catch and kill three murderers because the government does not trust the local police to use guns to keep the streets safe or private persons to use guns to defend their own lives.  &#10;&#10;Why do some in radical Islam kill innocents in the West in order to affect the policies of Western governments? Might it be because the fruitless Western invasion of Iraq killed 650,000 persons, most of whom were innocent civilians? Might it be because that invasion brought al-Qaida to the region and spawned ISIS? Might it be because Obama has killed more innocent civilians in the Middle East with his drones than were killed by the planes in the U.S. on 9/11?  &#10;&#10;Might it be because our spies are listening to us, rather than to those who pose real dangers?  &#10;&#10;What does all this have to do with freedom of speech? Nothing -- unless you believe the French government.  	The French government has prohibited speech it considers to be hateful and&#10;even made it criminal.&#10;&#10;
279-whathappensoilpricescollapsech	guardian	2015-01-12T09:01:44Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/12/what-happens-oil-prices-collapse-cheaper-fuel-us-europe	Francisco Monaldi	Here’s what happens when oil prices crash – and it’s not pretty for producers	The longest and biggest oil boom in history is over. In a boom – and the latest one lasted almost 10 years – everything shines for producer nations: the economy grows, consumption explodes, businesses make fat profits regardless of their productivity, poverty declines even if social protection programmes are ineffective, politicians are popular and get re-elected even if they are incompetent and corrupt, and people tend to be happier.  &#10;&#10;But oil prices tend to be cyclical, so when the downturn comes, the party ends. During the oil price decline of the 1980s, most oil-dependent countries suffered the consequences of the resulting collapse in investment and consumption. A few, such as Oman and Malaysia, were able to compensate for the price collapse by increasing production, but many oil exporters suffered, also due to the production cuts agreed by Opec. Some recovered better than others, but in general between 1982 and 2002 they fared much more poorly than the rest of the developing world.  &#10;&#10;Those that fared worst were typically the ones that got into debt during the boom. Poverty and unemployment rose sharply. In fact, such underperformance led to the widespread idea that having oil is a curse, which has generated extensive literature. The reality is more complex, as shown by economic overperformance during the past decade’s boom. In fact, taking out those two “bust” decades, oil countries have outperformed their peers over the past 70 years. So the real “curse” is in fact an oil price collapse.  &#10;&#10;The current price collapse – for the first time since 2009 prices are below the symbolic $50 a barrel – is largely a result of the boom in shale oil production in the US, adding more than 3m barrels over the past few years. High prices bring investment and supply, and this boom was no different. Oil prices are notoriously difficult to predict, so we do not know if the current bust will last, despite evidence that points to at least two more years of lower prices. Moreover, prices are still above historical standards. For the majority of the more than 120 years of history of the oil industry the price has been below $50 in today’s money. But geopolitics or renewed consumption could alter the oversupply scenario and surprise us once again. In fact, oil busts tend to lead to booms down the road precisely because investment in oil exploration dries up.  &#10;&#10;Net importers, like most European countries, will benefit from the oil price decline. In the US, citizens will pay significantly less for gasoline than they have over the past five years, leading them to spend more on other goods. A vast transfer of wealth from exporters to importers is occurring.  &#10;&#10;Even if the fall is short term, some pain will be suffered by all net oil exporters, but it will only be disastrous for the countries that failed to learn the lessons of the previous boom and bust cycle. This time around many countries have saved a larger part of their windfall and invested more in productive assets, although generally significantly less than the value of the resource being depleted. Many abandoned their conservative fiscal policies during the financial crisis of 2008-09, which made sense, but they never got back to the prudence of the first few years of the boom.  &#10;&#10;Middle Eastern producers were prompted to increase spending by the unrest produced by the Arab Spring. Still, with few exceptions, most exporters are in better shape to weather the storm. The wealthy countries of the Gulf, and some of the Caspian countries, can easily manage a temporary fall in prices – they have accumulated large external funds, although some face more worrisome long- term fiscal prospects. Even Russia is in a better position to manage the oil fall than the Soviet Union was, but it would still suffer from the necessary cuts in imports and spending, and the sanctions will hurt more. Iran is in worse shape because it had a less prudent economic policy and sanctions had already produced a crisis even before the fall in the oil price. Nigeria, despite an improved macro policy in comparison with the previous boom, is going to be significantly affected due to its excessive dependence on oil, leading to an increase in poverty and political instability. Angola is also vulnerable. Latin American oil exporters with generally prudent macro policies, like Colombia and Mexico, will also be affected by the necessary fiscal adjustment, but they should be able to manage it with limited trauma. However, no country is in worse shape entering into the price collapse than my home country, Venezuela.  &#10;&#10;As the proverbial grasshopper of the fable, Venezuela did not only spend throughout the summer, mostly in consumption, but it also went into a debt binge to afford even more consumption: the country was running deficits of 15%-20% of GDP during the peak boom years. Now comes the winter and it faces economic collapse. Inflation could top 100% in 2015, shortages are widespread, and there is a high probability that many Venezuelans who came out of poverty during the boom will fall back into it, with serious consequences for political stability.  &#10;&#10;Oil abundance is not necessarily a curse. Most producers are better prepared this time around, but for the few that learned nothing from the past, the reality will be as harsh as the grasshoppers’ winter.  	Francisco Monaldi: While cheaper fuel beckons for the US and Europe, weak oil-producing nations face hardship from the vast transfer of wealth
280-whatnotbeingreportedazerbaij	aljazeera	Sun, 18 Jan 2015 06:54:45 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/01/what-not-being-reported-azerbaij-20151684331464440.html	Arzu Geybullayeva	What is not being reported in Azerbaijan	While global media appears to be focused on debating the limitations on free speech in France following the attack on the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, it is worth remembering that France is not the only country whose media professionals are targeted.  &#10;&#10;For years, journalists in Azerbaijan have suffered harsh penalties for defending their freedom of speech - from prison sentences to interrogation and the confiscation of broadcasting equipment.  &#10;&#10;On December 26, at around 10:30am, a group of police officers and investigators stormed the Baku bureau of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, ransacking the company's safe, seizing company documents, the official seal and equipment, while keeping the staff hostage in a conference room for over five hours. Once the search was over, the office was sealed shut. The staff was let go only to be forcefully summoned a day later at the heavy crimes unit of the state prosecutor's office for questioning.  &#10;&#10;In just a few days, over 30 former and current staff members of RFE/RL were questioned, including the bureau's cleaner. On December 30, the government accused the radio and its staff of espionage, money laundering and appropriation of funds as part of the ongoing criminal investigation against foreign-funded entities in Azerbaijan.  &#10;&#10;Similar measures were taken against Institute for Reporters' Freedom and Safety (IRFS), the Media Rights Institute, and International Research and Exchanges Board (IREX). The offices of all three were raided in August and sealed shut with IREX leaving the country shortly after. The director of IRFS, Emin Huseynov, remains in hiding.  &#10;&#10;Consistent targeting  &#10;&#10;This is not the first time the RFE/RL station, locally called Azadliq Radio (Liberty Radio) is targeted by the authorities. In 2009, its FM broadcast was shut down. BBC radio service and Voice of America followed suit. For years, the police harassed the radio's reporters, often confiscating or breaking their equipment or detaining them for endless hours of interrogation.  &#10;&#10;On December 5, Azadliq Radio investigative journalist and the host of the radio's daily show, Khadija Ismayilova, was arrested and placed in pre-trial detention for two months. Accused of "incitement to suicide" or "an attempt to suicide" as per Article 125 of the Criminal Code, Ismayilova remains in jail - even though her accuser, Tural Mustafayev, has withdrawn his complaint.  &#10;&#10;Mustafayev had accused Ismayilova of inciting him to attempt suicide and "insulting his honour and dignity on social networks and among her friends following the break-up of their relations and his intention to marry another woman". On December 30, the Baku Court of Appeal dismissed Ismayilova's appeal for house arrest.  &#10;&#10;Prior to this charge, Ismayilova was already facing an unrelated criminal trial for defamation linked to her posting a document on Facebook revealing the identity of a man who was an informant for Azerbaijan's intelligence services.  &#10;&#10;In October, when travelling for a conference in Prague, Ismayilova was prevented from leaving the country. A little over a week before this trip, Ismayilova was searched and detained for four hours at Baku International Airport. She was returning from Strasbourg where she talked about the deteriorating human rights conditions in Azerbaijan.  &#10;&#10;Her investigative work uncovered many of the hidden and illegal business dealings of the ruling Aliyev family and other government officials for which she is recognised internationally. Ismayilova is the recipient of Global Shining Award, the Gerd Bucerius Free Press of Eastern Europe Award, the Courage of Journalism Award, and named one of the Brave Thinkers of the world by Atlantic magazine.  &#10;&#10;Was it a coincidence that Ismayilova's detention came just a day after the country's chief of staff, Ramiz Mehdiyev, accused Ismayilova of treason and being a foreign spy? Or that the radio station was raided and then closed in another few weeks time?  &#10;&#10;In his 60-page diatribe on "Western Colonialism", Mehdiyev wrote: "Their main concern is lip service to their bosses abroad and keeping good relations with them. The example is Azadliq Radio's journalist Kahdija Ismayilova. Together with her colleague 'friends' she puts on anti-Azerbaijani shows, makes absurd statements, openly demonstrates destructive attitude towards well-known members of the Azerbaijani community, and spreads insulting lies. It is clear this sort of defiance pleases Ms Ismayilova's patrons abroad."  &#10;&#10;He concluded: "Overall there is an understanding within the society that Azadliq Radio and its employees are on a disgusting path. There is no need to prove that provision of false information is the same as working for the foreign secret service. This is treason. This is what journalists and people with a healthy mindset would think. If the symbol of democracy is Khadija Ismayilova, then it is awful to imagine what future awaits the society."  &#10;&#10;Siyavush Novruzov, an MP from the ruling party, agrees. In an interview with a local news site, Novruzov said: "Every place that works for foreign intelligence and the Armenian lobby should be searched."  &#10;&#10;The Armenian lobby is just another popular tool used by government circles to punish dissent in Azerbaijan. Despite its support for Track Two diplomacy initiatives, Aliyev's regime was quick to accuse Leyla Yunus and Rauf Mirkadirov of treason and spying for Armenia this year.  &#10;&#10;Both Yunus and Mirkadirov have been engaged in public diplomacy initiatives pressing for reconciliation between Armenia and Azerbaijan for over a decade. The authorities were fully aware of their work for years.  &#10;&#10;And yet, in what has been by far the most unprecedented year of crackdowns, Azerbaijan continues to maintain a steady relationship with Europe and the image of a transforming country, young and rich, and eager to spend so long as its critics keep quiet.  &#10;&#10;With many of the country's prominent advocates, lawyers, and journalists in jail; independent media platforms under attack; and only a handful of international non-governmental organisations left in the country, there is little hope for the country's positive transformation anytime soon.  &#10;&#10;So long as President Ilham Aliyev keeps saying there are no political prisoners and no limitations on freedom of speech in Azerbaijan - conjuring the illusion of a democratic country - little is going to change in this country.  	So long as the government keeps saying there are no limitations on freedom of&#10;speech, nothing will change in Azerbaijan.&#10;&#10;

His State of the Union address sounded like his other speeches: What I’ve done is great! America is in a much better position. We’ve created a manufacturing sector that’s adding jobs. More oil is produced at home. I cut deficits in half!  &#10;&#10;Give me a break. The deficit is lower now not because of any prudence on Obama’s part but merely because the $800 billion stimulus spending blowout didn’t continue. All the president does is increase spending: free community college, free Obamaphones, free birth control, etc. Yes, our annual deficit is lower, but it’s still $488 billion! Our $18 trillion national debt increases by $3 million every minute!  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Yes, more oil is produced at home, but that’s in spite of the administration. Oil production is down on public land.  &#10;&#10;Yes, the manufacturing sector added jobs, but that’s mostly because of cheaper natural gas created by fracking, which Obama’s cronies opposed. Also, America is finally recovering from recession. Obama’s policies probably slowed that recovery.  &#10;&#10;Does the President delude himself when he takes credit for oil production, lower deficits, etc.? Or does he mislead on purpose? I don’t know.  &#10;&#10;More recently he bragged, “I created the lowest unemployment rate in years.” He created it? He must know it’s “low” only compared to the 10 percent reached during the recession -- and because millions have simply given up looking for work. This recovery is the slowest in 70 years.  &#10;&#10;If Obama gave the State of the Union address I‘d like to hear, he’d say this:  &#10;&#10;I heard you, voters, in November when you took control of the Senate away from my party. I get it. I overreached. I was arrogant. I imposed Obamacare on a nation that was deeply divided about it. I ruled through executive orders instead of legislation. I threw money at “green” nonsense. I’ll give up the payments to the “green energy” industry if the Republicans stop coddling defense contractors.  &#10;&#10;I’ve been in government for years now. I know how badly it works. The last thing I should try to do is make it bigger. In fact, with Republicans now in control of Congress, it’s time I worked with them to shrink government. If we shrink it, we might even dig our way out of the debt hole we’re in. Heck, if we just slow the growth of government to 2 percent a year, we’d be in better shape.  &#10;&#10;But I didn’t even try to accomplish that. I pretended taxing the rich would solve our financial problems. But there aren’t enough rich people to tax. I got drunk on the idea of promising voters “free” stuff such as low down- payment mortgages and guaranteed paid family leave. I told them that all good things come from government. That’s nonsense.  &#10;&#10;We should put an end to all bailouts. Businesses that screw up should accept the consequences, just like ordinary people who spend recklessly. Main Street should never again be forced to rescue Wall Street.  &#10;&#10;Instead of expanding government control of health care, we should phase it out. That includes Medicare. I know Medicare is popular, but it is unsustainable. Let current retirees receive their benefits as promised, but younger people should pay for their own health care.  &#10;&#10;People criticize the economic distortion created by welfare, but Medicare and Social Security are almost as bad. Both redistribute money away from the young and struggling toward those of us who have had decades to invest and save up.  &#10;&#10;To make these challenges a little easier to deal with, let’s make America richer by abolishing most regulations. They strangle opportunity.  &#10;&#10;The more I think about it, the more Congress and I could transform America for the better just by getting out of America’s way. The state of our union will be truly strong if the state -- by which I mean government -- is strictly limited.  &#10;&#10;John Stossel is the host of "Stossel" (Thursdays at 9 PM/ET), a weekly program highlighting current consumer issues with a libertarian viewpoint.

Yet a key obstacle to this progress continues to be high levels of violence against women.  &#10;&#10;The legal system has failed to protect women adequately when it comes to some of the most common crimes against them; rape, domestic violence, underage and forced marriages.  &#10;&#10;That is why, in 2009, a number of prominent Afghan women's rights activists, members of civil society groups, and some lawmakers came together to draft a bill to better protect women through legal channels and to define crimes of violence against women. The bill, known as The Elimination of Violence Against Women (EVAW) Law, was decreed into law through an Executive Order by the former Afghan President Hamid Karzaion, on July 20, 2009, while parliament was in recess.  &#10;&#10;During such periods, the Afghan Constitution allows the president to issue decrees for emergency purposes, but the Constitution also requires such decrees to be forwarded to parliament for approval. Some women activists nonetheless suggested that it was not necessary to send the EVAW law to parliament.  &#10;&#10;Political climate  &#10;&#10;Others, including myself, argued that although the Executive Order on EVAW was a significant step in the battle for the elimination of violence against women, the law remained vulnerable to being reversed by a new president. Indeed, presidential elections were just around the corner.  &#10;&#10;As the drawdown of the international troops drew nearer, we feared that the political climate would make it increasingly difficult to get the law anchored in parliament. In addition, we feared that any peace talks with the Taliban could end up sacrificing EVAW in a bid to appease the militants. Securing parliamentary approval for the law would give us much stronger ammunition in protecting it against extremist attacks.  &#10;&#10;In order to get an agreement on the EVAW law in parliament, we worked tirelessly for months, using three main strategies. Firstly, we started a lobbying campaign with those who opposed the law, mainly conservatives.  &#10;&#10;Secondly, we went to visit them in their houses, explaining the law to them article by article to obtain their signature in support of the law. We also organised exchange visits for conservative MPs to other Muslim countries so they could explore how these countries had been enforcing similar legislation for decades.  &#10;&#10;Finally we worked through the joint committee in parliament for more than two years to develop a consensus on the law and defuse the opposition of conservatives. In late 2009, there were only two issues left where conservative MPs did not agree.  &#10;&#10;These were the law's punishment of relatives for underage marriage and for polygamy under certain conditions as well as the fact that women's rights advocates wanted to include "honour killings" as a specific crime in the law.  &#10;&#10;At this point, however, MPs became increasingly preoccupied with the then- upcoming parliamentary elections scheduled for Spring 2010, thus the process lost momentum.  &#10;&#10;Unfortunately, after the 2010 parliamentary elections, we ended up with a more conservative parliament. Contested election results left the new parliament paralysed for almost a year. As a consequence, discussions about the EVAW law only resumed in mid-2011.  &#10;&#10;At this time the draft was re-sent to the 18 parliamentary commissions. All but one of the commissions agreed with the text of the law or presented constructive suggestions. The final commission, the legislative (Taqnin) committee, headed by the foremost opponent of the EVAW law, submitted 34 pages of suggested amendments.  &#10;&#10;Some of these suggestions were helpful and were duly included, such as a proposal to have specialised prosecution units in all of Afghanistan. As before, we rejected the proposals to leave underage marriage and the contraction of invalid polygamous marriages as non-punishable acts. We similarly rejected a new suggestion which was to close all women's shelters and arrange for the victims of violence to stay with relatives instead.  &#10;&#10;Although the opponents were vocal, they did not outnumber the rest. What was damaging, however, was an unhealthy political rivalry that ensued among mostly female parliamentarians and supporters of EVAW. Some progressive women's rights activists, including some from international organisations, argued that the time was not right to pass the EVAW and that it should be left as a presidential decree.  &#10;&#10;There were good reasons for seeking parliamentary approval. Yet some of my colleagues began accusing me of using the bill to further my own political career and gain support for my assumed ambitions for the 2014 presidential elections.  &#10;&#10;Instead of supporting EVAW, many female MPs stood silent during the parliamentary debates on the bill and some even went as far as to lobby against it. As a result, when the law was presented to the plenary in May 2013, conservative MPs who were opposed to EVAW were further emboldened.  &#10;&#10;The new Speaker of the House did not hold a lot a lot of influence and probably, for that reason, did not back the bill either.  &#10;&#10;With the conservative MPs entrenched in their opposition to EVAW, a weak speaker and a lack of support from my fellow female MPs, the EVAW bill failed to pass.Those of us who saw the passing of EVAW to be beyond politics, and understood its importance for tackling violence against women, were left heartbroken.  &#10;&#10;With the international community now gradually disengaging from Afghanistan, time is running out for Afghan women. We have made important gains since 2001, but we need the force of the law behind us to sustain our achievements.  &#10;&#10;We need to arm ourselves with solid laws like the EVAW law to fight the violence and other ills of our society which are destroying the souls of our sisters across the country. The fact that the EVAW law has not been approved by the parliament is the reason for its weak implementation rates; many justice officials are questioning the law's status and therefore do not apply it.  &#10;&#10;One promising thing on the horizon is that we now have a president and chief executive who both understand the multitude of challenges facing women. I would like to take this opportunity and call on President Ashraf Ghani and our Chief Executive Dr Abdullah Abdullah to declare their support for the passage of the EVAW bill.  &#10;&#10;I also call on my female colleagues in parliament and all Afghan women rights activists and our international partners to set aside their differences and join us in support of the ratification of the bill. As the recent parliamentary approval of the BSA shows, when the government and others make something a priority, the conservative MPs can be isolated.  &#10;&#10;Times may be difficult now for Afghanistan, differences may be wide and security challenges are growing, but failure to back the EVAW and allowing it to die will deal a severe blow to Afghan women's rights.

The shooting death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by a white policeman rightly set off alarms.  &#10;&#10;But much less media attention — especially from the black civil rights leadership — has gone to the deadly assault on a white man by three black teenage boys in St. Louis, which is likely to end with adult murder convictions and life sentences for the boys. That sentence equals a long, slow death in jail just as final and awful as Michael Brown’s fate.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;St. Louis police and politicians say there was nothing racial about the attack on Zemir Begic, 32, a Bosnian immigrant. They say it was not a hate crime aimed at Bosnians. And they say it had nothing to do with the racial crisis in Ferguson over Brown’s death.  &#10;&#10;Yes, it did.  &#10;&#10;Black men have the highest rate of conviction for violent crime of any racial group in the country. The harsh truth is that we’re really talking about poor, young Black men. In any case, Blacks have the highest dropout and unemployment rates. Black children have the highest poverty rate of any group of children.  &#10;&#10;Poor black boys too often take their fashion and cultural cues from rap music that celebrates criminal behavior as a show of power and rebellion. Often, the result is a thuggish attitude, including dressing like convicts with their pants falling down because the jail guards have taken away their belts.  &#10;&#10;Another consequence of civil rights leaders’ failure to challenge criminal behavior in black neighborhoods is the angry, defiant interactions between those black teenagers and the police.  &#10;&#10;Once the black violence leads to death, especially if it is beyond the streets of a poor black neighborhood, there is no mercy. The broken justice system that gives police a pass for killing an unarmed black teen is hard evidence that Americans, middle-class blacks and whites, think classifying young black men as an ongoing threat to public safety is not racial stereotyping.  &#10;&#10;And the police and grand jurors see physically large black men — in the cases of both Michael Brown and New York’s Eric Garner, who was choked to death by police — as especially threatening.  &#10;&#10;How else do you explain the lack of human compassion by the police for Garner as he complained, “I can’t breathe”? How else do you understand two grand juries deciding there is nothing wrong with two people being killed by the police, agents of the government, if the value of their lives is equal to every other citizen’s life?  &#10;&#10;In Garner’s case, the police were videotaped choking him even though he never fought with them. And the grand jurors still refused to allow the police to go on trial.  &#10;&#10;Mandatory body cameras for police are a good idea, but they are not a panacea for the troubled relationship between the larger society and the broken black families, the poorly educated black children and the steady violence in poor black American communities. Recall that Garner’s death at the hands of the police is on videotape, and it made no difference in the grand jury’s decision not to indict the police.  &#10;&#10;Even with the video, what the prosecutor and the grand jurors saw in Garner was not a fellow citizen being hurt, but a troubling social reality. They saw a potential threat to themselves in a big black man hustling on the street, even if this was a middle-aged man with no violent intent who was violating only a minor law by selling loose cigarettes.  &#10;&#10;Garner and Brown are in their graves, but the body count continues as poor black teenagers, especially boys, march from single-parent homes to bad schools, to jails and to wasted lives. It begins with acting out in defiance of a larger society that ignores them. Sometimes there are displays of anger that are seen as threatening, and they end up killing each other. Other times there are confrontations with the police that end with the boys in jail or the grave.  &#10;&#10;Robert Joseph Mitchell, the 17-year-old charged with first-degree murder in the attack on Begic, looks to fit in that group of poor, young black men in the “pipeline” to prison. Also in the “pipeline” to wasted lives are two other black boys, 15 and 16, whom police arrested after the murder. And don’t forget Begic, an innocent man having fun with his fiancée who lost his life because he crossed paths with these furious black boys.  &#10;&#10;This is the deeper social breakdown born of segregation of poor black people, lack of opportunity and too many people living with acceptance of anger at the poor for making the larger society so uncomfortable, so fearful.  &#10;&#10;The protests over the Brown and Garner cases deserve to be celebrated in the American tradition of social movements against injustice. But where are the protests over the drive-by shootings of black thugs by other black thugs? Where are the protests against the bad schools that close the door of economic opportunity on poor children, disproportionately poor children of color?  &#10;&#10;As Robert Joseph Mitchell faces a life sentence for murder, his story is one more tragic version of “I can’t breathe.”  	The shooting death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by a white&#10;policeman rightly set off alarms. But much less media attention — especially&#10;from the black civil rights leadership — has gone to the deadly assault on a&#10;white man by three black teenage boys in St. Louis, which is likely to end&#10;with adult murder convictions and life sentences for the boys. That sentence&#10;equals a long, slow death in jail just as final and awful as Michael Brown’s&#10;fate.&#10;&#10;

To many people overseas, the United States government is viewed as an aggressive empire of military bases, drones, and special forces that transcend national borders. But to big corporations, the US government is a patsy that gives away trillions of dollars of natural resources, tax revenues and public assets to grasping giant companies and industries.  &#10;&#10;The US has an unsurpassed record of transferring what belongs to all Americans to a few giant business interests. Unlike any other country, the federal government, under the 1872 Mining Act, gives away hard rock minerals (eg gold, silver, platinum, molybdenum) discovered on federal lands that belong to the American people, to the foreign or domestic companies that find these minerals. In 1986, for example, a gold company found over $9bn worth of gold under federal land in Nevada.  &#10;&#10;The company bought rights to that gold for $5 per acre (less than $6,000 total) without having to pay any royalties on the mined gold back to the Department of Interior. For over 100 years, valuable minerals worth hundreds of billions of dollars have been given away to the mining industry for $5 or less per acre. Once these mines are exhausted, the law only requires companies to do little to clean up their toxic waters and waste.  &#10;&#10;As for other natural resources on federal land such as timber, grazing fields, oil, gas and coal, the companies pay very low fees to the government to obtain these valuable natural resources.  &#10;&#10;The public airwaves belong to the people. Yet, under a law passed in 1934 by the radio lobby (sustained later by the television industry), the broadcasting stations control their licensed portion of the broadcast spectrum 24/7 for free. As tenants they pay nothing to the Federal Communications Commission, which represents the landlords, who are the people. These free licenses allow radio and television stations to exclusively decide who gets airtime and who does not. Entertainment and advertisements now make up over 90 percent of the broadcasting time of these very profitable commercial stations, using our public airwaves.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;For many decades, the federal government has used taxpayer-funded research and development as hand-outs for private industries in the US. For instance, the research and development of the Pentagon has resulted in technologies that built the aero-space, computer and containerisation industries. It was the Pentagon that funded the basic and applied research that led to the creation of the Internet.  &#10;&#10;The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has transferred, for free, many diverse technologies that were developed through taxpayer-funded research and development to the transportation, detection and medical service industries.  &#10;&#10;The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has funded many of the major pharmaceuticals which, under contracts known as CRADA agreements, are given away to large drug companies.  &#10;&#10;The anti-cancer drug, Taxol, was developed with $31m of taxpayer funds by the National Cancer Institute and, after clinical testing, given away to Bristol- Myers-Squibb under a monopoly marketing agreement. The biotechnology industry was formed out of free NIH research programmes. Without a century of freely transferred research and development investments by the US Department of Agriculture, pesticide, herbicide and other chemical industries would not be where they are today.  &#10;&#10;At the state and local level, companies and their consulting firms put the location of new factories, warehouses or large retail stores up for bidding by the states and municipalities. It becomes a race to the bottom by states and municipalities competing against each other to create the most "business friendly environment" with incentives like tax breaks, cash donations and other subsidies to convince companies to locate to a community called corporate welfare or crony capitalism. These deals amount to governments paying companies to make money while depleting their public tax base that pays for schools, public works and other public services.  &#10;&#10;Recently, Tesla, the electric car company, put the location of a proposed one billion dollar factory to produce lithium ion batteries up for bid. Texas, California, Arizona, and Nevada offered large giveaways in incentive subsidies. Nevada won, offering a package worth at least $1bn that included tax vacations, cash reimbursements of expenses and even a cash bonus for signing.  &#10;&#10;Similarly, professional sports businesses have routinely demanded taxpayer- funded stadiums and ballparks as a condition of either staying in a city or relocating to another.  &#10;&#10;Many billions of dollars have been spent to make these rich football and baseball giants even richer. This is money that could have been spent to create and improve neighbourhood recreational facilities for participatory sports and healthy exercise. Under those corporate subsidies, the taxpayers are paying far too much (sometimes between $100,000 to $200,000 per job) for their governments' race to the bottom during these bidding wars.  &#10;&#10;There are many thousands of similar corporate subsidy programmes, which are not regularly reviewed by the federal government. Instead, Congress just lets them continue on indefinitely without regulatory standards, cost-benefit tests or sunset provisions, which is exactly what these corporate lobbyists are paying for with their ample campaign contributions to these indentured legislators.  &#10;&#10;The most profitable companies in the world make demands for such subsidies. Some years ago the former CEO of Intel Corporation, Andy Grove, testified before the Senate urging continuation of the generous tax credits given to computer companies like Cisco, Microsoft, Google, and Apple. These are companies with staggering profit margins, year after year.  &#10;&#10;Grove was candid when he told the Senators that his industry was not very eager to spend money to do basic research. What these companies do, he noted, is apply the research to their products and services. He called on the government to take this responsibility by extending tax credits (big checks) from the Treasury to pay companies to do such basic work.  &#10;&#10;The unfairness of all these giveaways is inducing a Left-Right alliance that opposes such giveaways. The Left calls this corporate welfare, while the Right calls it crony capitalism. Thus far, the politicians from both the Democratic and the Republican parties have not wanted to make these giveaways debatable issues in their electoral campaigns or the subject of thorough congressional or state legislative hearings.  &#10;&#10;The time is coming for a Left-Right public coalition to go operational and exert political demands for reform of this gigantic largesse, while many other necessities of the people are subjected to cruel, austere cutbacks.  	The US federal government continues to use taxpayer-funded research and&#10;development as hand-outs for private industries.&#10;&#10;
285-whitepeopledeclaredbaeoverblac	guardian	2015-01-14T17:30:02Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/14/white-people-declared-bae-over-black-people-can-use-it	Robin Boylorn	Now that white people have declared 'bae' over, black people can use it in peace	While “bae” only made its way to mainstream parlance in the last few years, it is a word that most black folk have been intimately familiar with for decades. Its etymology was unclear, but its meanings and nuances are deeply understood in context. “What’s up, bae?” “That’s my bae,” etc., have been ways of staking claim and announcing intimacy between oneself and one’s (sometimes prospective) lover. Bae is also used as a term of endearment and affection for someone with whom there is no romantic involvement or interest (not unlike “honey” or “sweetheart” is used in Southern dialogue), as in “Hey bae, can you pass me that plate?”  &#10;&#10;And then Pharrell put it in a song, Miley Cyrus did a cameo, and it gained the attention of mainstream media. Suddenly there were articles attempting to define the word “bae”, otherwise reputable businesses began implementing “bae” in their social media ad campaigns, and everybody and they mama started using it. At which point it was declared overused by organs of upper-class white folk media like Time magazine.  &#10;&#10;Fair enough: white people’s adoption of the term distorted it to the point of misuse and meaninglessness. What was once a word born of the beautifully eclectic black Southern laziness of the tongue and a shortened version of baby, became a catchall term for anything from inanimate objects to food. The reference to affection was consistent but bae was used to describe everything from one’s (desired or actual) significant other to pancakes. “That’s bae”, a student swooned, glancing at a picture of J Cole during a discussion of black masculinity last summer in class. “These cupcakes are bae”, I read in a Facebook post attached to a picture of a delicious-looking dessert not many months later. And just like that, the shelf life of bae in the public imagination expired and the gatekeepers of mainstream language decided that it must be banned.  &#10;&#10;Cultural appropriation at its best, steals, reduces, overuses and then disposes of words like so much bathwater. The linguist Jane H Hill defines language appropriation as “a type of complex cultural borrowing that involves a dominant group’s ‘theft’ of aspects of a target group’s language.” Hill claims that the ‘theft’ adds value to white identity while further marginalizing nondominant groups. This cultural “borrowing” of black language and phraseology happens regularly, allowing non-black folk to “try on” black culture through the use of African American English vernacular and slang without having to “put on” the cultural consequences of actually being black in a culture conditioned to devalue and dismiss it.  &#10;&#10;As Hill claims, language appropriation is further problematic because it gives dominant groups control over the language. Dominant groups get to decide, for example, when and if certain words are worth appropriation, when and how the words should be used, and then when the word becomes cliché, overused and therefore passé. And often in the process, as happened with “bae”, the dominant group ends up changing the meaning or pronunciation of words entirely.  &#10;&#10;The good news is that black language is resilient and black folk are creative. So even when the dominant culture tries to dispose of the terms it wears out, other words and phrases will emerge. We already know some of them. Already you can see terms grounded in communities (“bye Felicia”), disguised in pronunciation (“ratchet”), or invented from imagination (“on fleek”) slipping into mainstream and popular culture lexicons (again). There, they will be mass produced for financial gain (again), and eventually disposed of (again).  &#10;&#10;So, what happens when mainstream culture decides to dispose of a word stolen from black language and then used to the point of saturation in popular culture? Nothing. The word may lose its novelty so that those who appropriated it stop saying or using it, but the word won’t disappear or lose its utility in the black community. We will go on saying bae. We will say it to our lovers in casual moments at home, and to our children to be endearing. We will say it in the grocery store, at the movie theatre and across church pews on Sunday mornings as a substitute for names. We will say it to each other – as we have always done – lovingly, reverently and mindfully. And with any luck, the word will settle back into its original meaning, sans the unsolicited remix of dominant white culture.  	Robin Boylorn: Majority culture’s adoption of the word, stolen from African American vernacular, distorted it to the point of misuse and meaninglessness

A spectre is haunting Germany and Europe and the spectre is called PEGIDA. Until recently only a few people had heard of PEGIDA, acronym for "Patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the Occident." It started as a small protest movement in the eastern city of Dresden against the influx of immigrants, foreign workers and asylum seekers and, above all, against the "Islamisation" of Germany.  &#10;&#10;Adopting the slogan "We are the people" of the weekly anti-communist demonstrations in 1989 which ultimately led to the overthrow of the German Democratic Republic, PEGIDA's appeal seems to have grown week after week. The hundreds of demonstrators of the first few Monday evening "walks" in Dresden have swollen to tens of thousands. Besides Dresden, there are now similar weekly rallies in other big German cities.  &#10;&#10;With its history of anti-Semitism and fascism many find it shocking that a considerable number of Germans, particularly in the east of the country, are flocking to a xenophobic, racist and Islamophobic movement. The surge of the anti-Islamisation movement has led to polarisation of the public opinion, many counter demonstrations and a fierce public debate, involving politicians, church leaders and academics. Chancellor Angela Merkel strongly criticised PEGIDA and called on Germans not to attend their rallies.  &#10;&#10;"Do not follow the people who organise these, for their hearts are cold and often full of prejudice, and even hate," Merkel said in her New Year's Eve speech.  &#10;&#10;Marginalised  &#10;&#10;Not everybody agrees. Development Minister Gerd Muller of the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), warned not to exclude PEGIDA sympathisers.  &#10;&#10;"The overwhelming majority of those demonstrators are not racists at all. Many of them are low income Germans and they feel they are being neglected, while refugees are offered help. The refugees, but also other migrants, are perceived by these people as competitors. In spite of our flourishing economy there are millions of poor families in Germany. The poor feel marginalised and not represented."  &#10;&#10;The CSU, Merkel's CDU's sister party and longtime political ally, has been accused of showing a bit too much understanding for PEGIDA. In fact the CSU's positions on immigration, integration and tougher rules for asylum seekers are quite similar to PEGIDA's.  &#10;&#10;It may well be that the CSU is distancing itself from Merkel because it is worried about right-wing competitors like the anti-establishment and eurosceptic AfD, Alternative für Deutschland (Germany's Alternative). The AfD may succeed in winning over many of the PEGIDA-sympathisers. AfD-chairman Bernd Lucke has gone out of his way to advocate a dialogue with this "new civil movement" and listen carefully to its arguments.  &#10;&#10;At the same time Lucke tried carefully not to alienate the more "respectable" right-wing voters and to distance himself from a too xenophobic discourse. Other AfD leaders are less ambiguous and clearly show support of PEGIDA by participating in their marches and inviting PEGIDA organisers to Saxony's regional parliament.  &#10;&#10;Some German observers don't doubt the existence of an alliance between AfD and PEGIDA. Analyst Volker Wagener sees the AfD as the "parliamentary voice of the street". He notes that the AfD manages to score with a xenophobic discourse especially in the east of Germany.  &#10;&#10;If the AfD succeeds in translating PEGIDA's objectives politically and electorally, it may take a role not unsimilar to Marine le Pen's National Front in France and especially Geert Wilders' Freedom Party in the Netherlands. In fact, there is a striking similarity between the anti- Islamisation positions of Geert Wilders and PEGIDA.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;Like Wilders' Freedom Party, PEGIDA does not only condemn jihadists and Islamist terrorists but Islam itself. Refugees, asylum seekers, migrants and the islamic religion are all lumped together in a vague, scary, threatening mix. Both the Freedom Party and PEGIDA claim to defend the "conservation of the Judeo-Christian heritage". Both claim not to be radical, but PEGIDA and Wilders' party do in fact appeal to right wing radicals and extremists. Neo- Nazis and violent "hooligans against Salafists" openly support PEGIDA.  &#10;&#10;Both forces represent a significant portion of the population in Germany and the Netherlands. If there would be parliamentary elections in the Netherlands now, Wilders' Freedom Party would be the first or second political force in the country (depending on which poll to believe). In Germany, around 30 percent of the population thinks PEGIDA's concerns are legitimate.  &#10;&#10;Some German experts say the debate shows the need for a redefinition of "who is a German" and recognition of Germany as an immigration country. According to a recent study, most Germans see somebody as "German" when he or she speaks German well and has a German passport. Some 38 percent of those polled said that women who wore headscarves could not be German.  &#10;&#10;To define a new concept of "German-ness" and promote a welcoming culture of tolerance and openness will not be an easy task, and should probably not be left to the politicians.  	Anti-Islam rallies are haunting Germany and the need to define a new concept&#10;of 'German-ness'.&#10;&#10;

John Barrasso	ObamaCare Opt-Out Act: Let all Americans make their own health care decisions 	  &#10;&#10;In the coming weeks, Americans will embark on the painful process of filing their tax returns. While this annual ritual leaves most people confused, depressed and overwhelmed, many will be faced with the additional step this year of paying hundreds or thousands of dollars if they chose not to purchase health insurance under ObamaCare for 2014.  &#10;&#10;Under the individual mandate required by the president’s new health care law, Americans for the first time must pay the higher of two penalties if they are uninsured and did not enroll in ObamaCare last year—either $95 per adult and $47.50 per child under 18, or 1 percent of their yearly household income above the $10,000 tax filing threshold. That means an individual earning $50,000 will face a penalty of $400 this year, and fines could reach up to $2,448 per person or up to $12,240 for a family of five.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Unfortunately, these penalty rates will only continue to climb. Next year, penalties will more than double for those who do not enroll in ObamaCare in 2015, costing the same individual earning $50,000 per year a whopping $800, and families up to tens of thousands of dollars.  &#10;&#10;No American should be forced into the president’s one-size-fits-all health care mandate. Health care should be based on the fundamental principle of freedom, and Americans should be able to have the ability to make their own health care decisions without fear that the government will extract onerous penalties from them.  &#10;&#10;That is why we reintroduced The ObamaCare Opt-Out Act of 2014 in the Senate last week, important legislation that will allow Americans to opt-out of the individual mandate for health insurance coverage required by ObamaCare. This bill would allow individuals to either notify their state or the federal health care exchange, or use their tax filing to opt-out of ObamaCare and avoid the penalty. According to the tax-services provider H&R; Block, this would impact about 4 million uninsured Americans in 2015.  &#10;&#10;After four years of ObamaCare, hardworking Americans continue to see their health care costs rise while their coverage choices diminish. It is far past time for American families to once again have the freedom to make their own decisions about what is best for their families.  &#10;&#10;As the 114th Congress gets underway, we will continue to make this bill a priority and work to restore Americans’ freedom to buy affordable health insurance that works for them because they know what’s best for their families, not the Obama administration.  	Health care should be based on the fundamental principle of freedom, and&#10;Americans should be able to have the ability to make their own health care&#10;decisions without fear that the government will extract onerous penalties from&#10;them.&#10;&#10;
288-whyciainterrogationsreportmatt	foxnews	2014-12-09T20:31:30Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/12/09/why-cia-interrogations-report-matters-torture-doesnt-work-and-americans-need-to/	Joe Navarro	Why CIA interrogations report matters: Torture doesn't work and Americans need to know	  &#10;&#10;As a former professional interviewer with the FBI, I know what works and doesn’t. Torture is not an effective way to get information, and the American people need to know that. That’s why the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA interrogation and detention after 9/11 is important.  &#10;&#10;The executive summary of the report, written after reviewing hundreds of thousands of the CIA’s internal documents, shows that torture was more brutal and much less fruitful than the CIA claimed. In fact, the committee concluded that all the claims about the value of intelligence gained from “enhanced” interrogation—including the claim that it helped the U.S. find Usama bin Laden—are overstated or just plain false.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Proponents of torture are contesting these well-documented findings.  &#10;&#10;So let’s look at the facts.  &#10;&#10;On 9/11, the CIA had few, if any, experienced counterterrorism interrogators. Their traditional purview had been intelligence collection during the Cold War. Inexperienced in this area and overwhelmed they resorted to techniques that merely sounded good but in fact worked against them.  &#10;&#10;When concocting the legal opinions to authorize torture, the lawyers inside our government didn’t consult trained interviewers or interrogation experts—the people who actually knew how to get information. They consulted psychologists who helped train U.S. military pilots to resist torture methods should they be captured (torture methods, it should be noted, designed to elicit false confessions).  &#10;&#10;If they had consulted trained interviewers, they would have found out what I and my colleagues had known for decades: Torture isn’t just unnecessary; it’s an unreliable way to get information.  &#10;&#10;Instead, as the Senate report shows, the CIA brought in untrained interrogators and contractors and asked them to get answers out of Al Qaeda detainees using methods designed to inflict pain, both physical and mental, and even simulate death. The CIA also employed horrific methods, like forced rectal feedings, that were never approved.  &#10;&#10;I recall when I learned that cruel techniques were being used. I spoke with several long-term CIA officers and CIA polygraph experts with whom I had worked over many years, and we were all appalled, not just by its immorality, but because we knew it would be counterproductive.  &#10;&#10;Apologists say that these methods were used to put the detainees into a state of “learned helplessness,” in which the detainee would depend totally on his captor and give up all information. Those of us who have actually conducted interviews know that this isn’t the way things work.  &#10;&#10;To get good, accurate information, you want the subject to be as cognizant as possible. You want him to be able to remember all the details and to be able to tell you them.  &#10;&#10;A person will say anything to try to stop the pain, and torture impairs the suspect’s ability to remember the details that may be essential to your investigation. Professionals don’t need to use torture and never have.  &#10;&#10;On top of that, torture is illegal, both here in the U.S. and internationally. The United States has even prosecuted people for the methods that the CIA used after 9/11. We are a nation of laws, and the conduct detailed in the Senate report is against the law.  &#10;&#10;For these reasons, in October, I joined 22 other security, interrogation and interviewing experts to issue a statement of principles in opposition to using torture. Not only is torture less reliable, illegal and immoral, we write, but it also makes our nation less safe.  &#10;&#10;When we are not using effective and legal interviewing tactics, we miss information that may be vital to our nation’s safety. In using torture, we also encourage other nations and actors (including terrorist groups) to emulate our illegal actions, effectively lowering the bar for the rest of the world, and allow them to use U.S. torture as a recruiting tool.  &#10;&#10;President Obama, on his second day in office, signed an executive order banning the CIA torture methods the Senate report describes. But this executive order could be overturned by a future president.  &#10;&#10;Now that the Senate report’s executive summary has been released and the public knows the just how ineffective and brutal U.S. torture was, we need to make sure that this prohibition is permanent. Working with Congress to pass legislation that makes sure a ban on torture extends to the CIA is one way that President Obama can make sure that the United States never again embraces the misguided, ineffective, and dangerous tactics of torture.  	As a former professional interviewer with the FBI, I know what works and&#10;doesn’t. Torture is not an effective way to get information, and the American&#10;people need to know that.&#10;&#10;

Such chastisement had meant something in the wake of 9/11 and the Bali bombings. Today, this has degraded into an automated knee-jerk response. It has been said so many times that its gravitas is greatly diminished.  &#10;&#10;More subtly, this expectation for Muslims to keep speaking out is nothing short of Islamophobic. It assumes that Islam is, at its core, evil. It also upholds the view that Muslims can be essentialised as a monolithic whole.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;The chastisement thus becomes the yardstick from which the wider world is to differentiate between a good Muslim and a bad Muslim.  &#10;&#10;Surely today, fourteen years after 9/11, we have wisened up to the fact that such atrocious acts are committed out of political, even criminal, intent more than theology. Surely, it is not a stretch to think that no one individual can represent an entire faith community. Surely, it is time, as Max Fisher of Vox argues, to stop asking Muslims to condemn terrorism.  &#10;&#10;In the same manner, this good Muslim, bad Muslim binary undergirds the #illridewithyou campaign.  &#10;&#10;Yes, the hashtag was borne out of goodwill; an Asian Australian woman started it, as the Twitter universe reacted to the story of a woman pledging to walk in solidarity with another woman who took her hijab off following news of the Sydney siege.  &#10;&#10;We will protect the good Muslims, so gestures the campaign. Unfortunately, it also reproduces an age-old trope that has been highlighted by scholars of postcolonial studies. As western colonisers encounter non-European natives, they began to think of their "other" in one of two antithetical ways - either as a barbaric savage or a noble savage.  &#10;&#10;To the colonisers, the hostile savage is inherently dangerous in a sub-human way and always an enemy to the civilised individual. Meanwhile, the noble savage is romanticised as innately benign. Untouched by modernisation, the noble savage should be admired and protected.  &#10;&#10;Transposed to modern times, the hostile savage translates as the bad Muslim and the noble savage - the good Muslim. Yet, barbaric or noble, a savage is still a savage. The hashtag #illridewithyou is just as patronising.  &#10;&#10;Another factor that cast doubt to #illridewithyou relates to this question: Was the perpetrator Man Haron Monis the quintessential Islamic extremist? If the slate of profile pieces that are now just flooding our newsfeed can be taken as a gauge, the jury is still out on this.  &#10;&#10;At first glance, one may indeed be tempted to fit him into the mould of what some security experts have called "bedroom jihadists", a fashionable term to describe self-radicalised individuals who have been recruited online to plan and execute terror attacks that would advance the cause of clandestine Islamist organisations.  &#10;&#10;Yet Monis was a man of many masks. Closer inspection would reveal that he does not nestle comfortably into this category. His demands may have included an ISIL flag, but he made no strategic overtures that would advance the cause of any oppressed Muslim groups. At this juncture, it is doubtful if he had even made contact with ISIL.  &#10;&#10;Let us also not forget that Monis was not a nobody who was secretly being turned to the ways of ISIL or any other Islamist agenda. In fact, he was a well-known criminal. Not only had Monis been charged with being an accessory to the brutal murder of his wife last year, he had also been slapped with 22 counts of aggravated sexual assault and 14 counts of aggravated indecent assault. In addition, information has surfaced that he had been charged with fraud in Iran, which requested his extradition from Australia some 14 years ago.  &#10;&#10;As a friend rightly pointed out on social media, Monis' criminal records qualify him as a "sexual predator and misogynist". Yet, this more dominant aspect of his identity has not stopped the rest of the world from linking the Sydney siege to the threat of Islamic fundamentalism.  &#10;&#10;Yet consider this. During the Sydney siege, a shooting spree incidence unfolded in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania that left 6 dead.  &#10;&#10;International media agencies described the perpetrator, the now-deceased Bradley William Stone, simply as "a suspect", "a gunman on the loose" and even "a Montgomery man". No hashtag campaign was necessary to assure white people that the rest of the world will ride with them to keep them safe.  &#10;&#10;The same can be observed of the reaction to the mass killings committed by the Norwegian Anders Breivik in 2011. While Breivik had claimed himself a baptised Christian in his 1,500-page manifesto, the world did not expect Christians to condemn terrorism in the same way Muslims had.  &#10;&#10;This discrepancy is telling of the power imbalance of our contemporary world. To white Australia, #illridewithyou may be its golden moment. To the rest of the coloured world, nothing has changed.  	The hashtag campaign is not challenging Islamophobia, but perpetuating it.&#10;&#10;

(AP)  &#10;&#10;Jan. 23, 2013: Gun rights advocates demonstrate at the Pennsylvania Capital building in Harrisburg, Pa. (AP)  &#10;&#10;A new Pew Research Center survey finds that, for the first time in their surveys, the majority of Americans oppose more gun control. Gallup and CNN polls tell a similar story. Opposition to gun control has been increasing over at least the last couple of decades.  &#10;&#10;Gun control groups have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to try to convince Americans that gun control is the answer. In 2013, gun owners’ groups — including the NRA — spent less than one seventh as much on television advertisements. This year looks to be even more lopsided, thanks to the unrelenting efforts of individuals such as Michael Bloomberg, George Soros and Gabriel Giffords.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Perceptions have changed dramatically, with most people now believing the “More Guns, Less Crime” hypothesis. Gallup recently asked Americans if they thought residents are safer with a gun in the home. People answered “Yes” by a margin of 63 to 30 percent. In 2000, Americans gave just the opposite answer by a margin of 51 to 35 percent. In 2013,[3] Sixty percent of gun owners listed “Personal Safety/Protection” as the reason for owning a gun.  &#10;&#10;Academic research aligns with current public opinion. If you have a gun in the home, that gun is far more likely to prevent murder than it is to be used in an accidental shooting or to kill a loved one.  &#10;&#10;Accidental gun deaths get a lot of press coverage, but the press is quite misleading when it talks about juvenile gun deaths . In fact, many news reports lump in young deaths involving gang fights. These deaths are also tragic, but they have nothing to do with whether law-abiding citizens should own guns.  &#10;&#10;The Centers for Disease Control reports that, in 2012, there were 58 accidental gun deaths involving children under the age of 15. More than 20 times as many children died due to accidental suffocation. In most cases, an adult accidentally shoots a child, not children shooting themselves or other children. And many of those adults have criminal records and drug or alcohol problems.  &#10;&#10;Between 2000 and 2014, the number of concealed handgun permits soared from about 2.7 million to well over 12 million. Similarly, the annual number of federal background checks increased from 8.5 to 21 million. According to Gallup, 42 percent of Americans now have a gun in the home.  &#10;&#10;The Pew Research Center survey found that 57 percent of Americans believe gun ownership “protects people from becoming victims of crime.” Thirty-eight percent believe that it “puts people’s safety at risk.” Support for gun ownership has grown particularly sharply among blacks and women, with their support since 2012 rising by 25 and 11 percentage points respectively.  &#10;&#10;My research shows that since blacks are the most likely victims of violent crime, they are also the ones who benefit most from being able to defend themselves. Women and the elderly are especially unlikely to be able to fend off a male attacker without the benefit of a firearm.  &#10;&#10;Gary Kleck, Larry Southwick and other academics have shown that having a gun is by far the safest option when confronted by a criminal.  &#10;&#10;Police are extremely important in reducing crime. Indeed, I have found that they are by far the single most important factor. But police know that they almost always arrive on the crime scene after a crime has occurred, and because of that police are among the strongest supporters for private gun ownership.  &#10;&#10;PoliceOne, which has a membership of about 450,000 active and retired police officers, found last year that 76 percent of its members believe legally armed citizens are either extremely or very important to stopping crime. Over 91 percent of members "support the concealed carry of firearms by civilians who have not been convicted of a felony and/or not been deemed psychologically/medically incapable." This is a less stringent standard than exists in most right-to-carry states.  &#10;&#10;In the wake of tragedies such as Newtown, gun control advocates keep pushing for more restrictions. But the proposed regulations have nothing to do with the tragedies. Even Mark Glaze, who was executive director of Bloomberg’s Everytown For Gun Safety until earlier this year, conceded to the Wall Street Journal, “Is it a messaging problem when a mass shooting happens and nothing that we have to offer would have stopped that mass shooting? Sure it’s a challenge….”  &#10;&#10;Even worse for gun control advocates, people are realizing that regulations — such as gun-free zones — tend to encourage attacks by disarming law-abiding citizens instead of criminals.  &#10;&#10;Hopefully, cities such as Washington, Los Angeles and New York will change their rules as more poor blacks and women recognize the benefits of gun ownership. At present, only rich, well-connected people can get concealed carry permits in those places. The poor have every bit as much right to defend themselves.  &#10;&#10;Increased gun ownership may solve another problem. There are two ways to protect poor law-abiding blacks in high-crime urban areas: Either rely more on the police or make it easier for people to defend themselves. Given the polls show that blacks have a greater trust in guns than the police making them safer, why not make it easier for law-abiding poor blacks to arm themselves?  &#10;&#10;John R. Lott, Jr. is a columnist for FoxNews.com. He is an economist and was formerly chief economist at the United States Sentencing Commission. Lott is also a leading expert on guns and op-eds on that issue are done in conjunction with the Crime Prevention Research Center. He is the author of eight books including "More Guns, Less Crime."

291-whytunisiasucceededwhereegy	aljazeera	Sat, 13 Dec 2014 06:03:51 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/why-tunisia-succeeded-where-egy-201412111643794562.html	Mark LeVine	Why Tunisia succeeded where Egypt failed	The coincidence couldn't be more striking. As Tunisians prepare for a run-off in their first full presidential elections, an Egyptian court has declared invalid all remaining murder and corruption charges against former President Hosni Mubarak, which stemmed from his three decades of misrule and the hundreds killed in the brutal crackdown he launched to preserve it.  &#10;&#10;While denizens of Tunis debate whether interim President Moncef Marzouki or Ben Ali era veteran Beji Caid Essebsi can best move the country forward, security forces in Cairo fired on crowds who attempted to enter Tahrir Square, the erstwhile centre of the revolution, to protest the Mubarak decision, killing at least one person while arresting dozens.  &#10;&#10;The untold thousands of peaceful protesters and activists rotting in Egypt's jails and the cult of personality today surrounding President Abdel Fattah el- Sisi tell the story of how the reluctant decision by Tahrir's revolutionaries to agree to a military-led transition turned out.  &#10;&#10;In Tunisia, the elements of the state, such as the interior ministry, remain bastions of the ancien regime. But the country has undeniably moved further than any Arab country towards a real and sustainable democracy. This should not surprise anyone familiar with Tunisia's history, as the country boasts the Arab - indeed, Muslim - world's first modern constitution, from 1861, and has long been among the most cosmopolitan and open in the region.  &#10;&#10;But the central issue today is precisely how the country built its post-Ben Ali leadership. Whatever one wants to say about the Islamist Nahda Party, its spiritual and political leader Rachid Ghannoushi re-entered Tunisian politics with a long history of supporting pluralism and democracy. And when it was clear that the party could not govern effectively, it ceded power and agreed to new elections, while members have engaged in public self-criticism about its failings.  &#10;&#10;Equally if not more important, Marzouki is one of the Arab world's most respected human rights figures, whose Congress for the Republic Party has brought together various opposition tendencies since its creation in 2001.  &#10;&#10;His term in office has been far from a sterling success - it could not have been otherwise, given the Herculean task of building a new governing system on the still functioning body of Ben Ali's mafia state.  &#10;&#10;But despite political assassinations, flaring religious extremism, and deep- seated economic problems, the country has moved to solidify a new civil and democratic political system. The contrast with the Egyptian post-revolutionary leadership couldn't be clearer.  &#10;&#10;There are many structural reasons why Tunisia has progressed politically while Egypt has seemingly returned to its pharaonic roots (as many commentators like to describe its penchant for authoritarian leaders). The most prominent are the exponentially greater power of the Egyptian military vis-a-vis its North African counterpart and its far larger, and poorer, population. But I would argue that the centrality, at least politically, of human rights to the national discourse has been one of the unheralded heroes of the post- revolutionary period. Just compare Tunisia and its president with the situation in Egypt. As Abdel Basset Hassan, head of the Arab Institute for Human Rights in Tunis and a long-time resident of Cairo, explained to me when we met in September, human rights are clearly being institutionalised to a strong degree.  &#10;&#10;The problem is that human rights is a frail political discourse. Whether in the most "advanced" democracies like the United States and UK, or developing countries like Egypt and Tunisia, it's easily swept aside by appeals to core national and/or religious identities and the creation of threats whose defeat inevitably requires watering down the protections afforded to all citizens. More broadly, human rights exists in a contradictory political framework: In most societies they both require revolutionary change to be fully implemented and yet are routinely violated in revolutionary situations where one form of power is, more or less violently, overpowering and superseding another.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;As revolutions from Iran to Cuba have shown, its all too easy for revolutions fought in the name of human rights, justice and dignity to themselves produce violent and repressive systems.  &#10;&#10;What's more, human rights is intimately tied to a notion of individual personhood that can all too easily be hijacked to a kind of market fundamentalist liberalism in which broad political freedom masks incredibly deep and destruction inequalities, exploitation, and repression - whether of colonised peoples "outremer" or of working classes at home.  &#10;&#10;Yet, for anyone who's experienced the Egyptian and Tunisian revolutions in action, the power and importance of human rights is undeniable. It remains one of the most radical concepts of the modern era; first, because it demands recognising others as inherently equal to oneself regardless of their differences - ethnic, racial, gender, religion, class, or nation. Second, they demand strict limitation on state power which is inherently and, unless checked, normatively abusive of citizens.  &#10;&#10;And this is where the situation in Tunisia remains perilous despite the smooth parliamentary and presidential elections of the last two months. While Marzouki's Congress for the Republic party represents a poorer and more traditional (and southern) component of Tunisian society, Essebsi's Nida Tounes Party is not merely tied to the old regime, but to the international financial interests to which it was beholden.  &#10;&#10;Indeed, the main threat in Tunisia today, in this regard, is not a religious- secular divide but left-neoliberal, with the two powerful parties working together to suppress all opposition to once again making Tunisia the Arab world's "poster child" for a "broken down" neoliberal reform model which has always produced - and masked - the desperate inequalities that led to the revolution against Ben Ali in the first place.  &#10;&#10;For decades, neoliberalism has produced the same results most everywhere it has been implemented: aggregate growth that mask growing inequality, increasing corruption, crime, environmental degradation and repression. The only check on such policies would be a strong and united left (the opposite of the present situation, by some accounts) centred broadly on labour rights, a fair distribution of wealth and resources and fighting against the corruption that fatally weakened the previous state.  &#10;&#10;But one of the signature strengths of neoliberal ideologies, from Kansas to Cairo, is precisely how efficiently they motivate people to support leaders and policies that are manifestly against their economic interests. A Nida Tounes-Nahda alignment would provide a powerful ideological and political cover for retrenching the policies that brought Tunisia to the brink of revolution.  &#10;&#10;On the other hand, there are more positive countervailing forces at work in Tunis that are cause for long-term hope. This process is exemplified by the establishment of Dar Essaida, or Saida House, a human rights centre located in and emerging from the local community in one of Tunis' poorest quarters. As Hassan explained, encouraging the poor and working class to (re)define the political and cultural discourses of human rights in ways that reflect their struggles and desires marks an important moment in the evolution of human rights practice.  &#10;&#10;"It's about implementing a complete vision, and as important, getting it out to the widest public," Hassan declared. "This is the only way to strengthen advances in areas such as women's rights or constitutional reforms. But the culture is harder to change, and you can't just root out all the networks of the former mafia state in one year, or even ten. It's a long process and it's not fruitful to use the angle of 'better or worse' to judge it now."  	The situation in Tunisia remains perilous despite the smooth parliamentary and&#10;presidential elections.&#10;&#10;
292-wideningwarmiddleeastsyria	aljazeera	Mon, 08 Dec 2014 10:52:39 GMT	http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/12/widening-war-middle-east-syria--201412855826696112.html	James Denselow	The widening war in the Middle East	It has been a week of air strikes "whodunnit" mysteries in the Middle East. Firstly, Al Jazeera broke the news that Iranian F-4 Phantoms were bombing ISIL in Iraq. The Iranians initially denied being in the same airspace bombing the same enemies as the Americans but later came clean about their role to the Guardian.  &#10;&#10;We've also heard rumours of the US A-10 "tank buster" arriving to support the US mission in Iraq although, again, nothing has been confirmed at this point. Then, on as normal a Sunday as Damascus has experienced in the last few years, the Syrian regime released grainy photographs supposedly showing the trails of Israeli aircraft following a bombing run on targets in the area. Among the rumoured sites that were hit were areas of Damascus International Airport. This caps a busy weekend for Syria's airbases which withstood ISIL attacks in the east of the country on Saturday.  &#10;&#10;While at a tactical level it is impossible to understand what impact the strikes have had, at a political level it works for all sides. The Syrian regime has used its conflict with Israel to justify an internal state of emergency and restrictions to freedoms for decades and can now sell to the war weary public who remain in their controlled areas, the twin threat of ISIL and Israeli "terrorism". For Benjamin Netanyahu, with elections looming, there is no better time for Israel's prime minister to act "prime ministerial" and remind voters of his eternal vigilance of the threat coming from Syria.  &#10;&#10;Indeed, earlier in the week, Netanyahu said that Israel "is following the Middle East and what is happening very closely, with wide open eyes and ears - and a lot is happening... We will continue to keep our fingers on the pulse and we will deal with these threats and these challenges, which never take time off".  &#10;&#10;In a letter to Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, Syria's foreign ministry claimed the bombing happened to distract from the break up of Netanyahu's coalition. Israeli officials meanwhile, would neither confirm nor deny the attacks with an Israeli army spokesman saying he would not comment on the "foreign reports".  &#10;&#10;While Syrian state media should always be read with a healthy pinch of salt, if confirmed, the latest Israeli attack comes in a series that preceded the outbreak of civil war.  &#10;&#10;There is a certain format to this low level state of eternal conflict between the two parties. Israel's September 2007 attack on Syria's al-Kibar facility was again initially unconfirmed but would eventually be told as a strategic masterstroke taking down Syria's nuclear programme at a critical time. Following the attacks, Syria responded with bombastic rhetoric over what it would do in the face of the strikes but nothing ever happened.  &#10;&#10;Since the Syrian uprising and civil war, Israel's primary concern has been with certain types of hi-tech weaponry going to Hezbollah, which was used to explain strikes in January and May of 2013. A year later and Israel responded to the very physical spillover of the Syrian conflict by launching strikes in June 2014 after shells were fired at their positions on the Golan Heights. Syria responded to the January bombings by warning of a "surprise", but in fact their actual reaction has been predictably mute.  &#10;&#10;  &#10;&#10;The airspace over Syria has never been busier with different nations pursuing different enemies with metrics of success hard to distinguish among the smoke and debris of the destruction. This weekend's attacks, if they are eventually claimed by Israel, would further entrench the growing irrelevance of many of the region's borders as recognised and respected lines. While the focus of global attention has been on ISIL's dismantling of the Iraq-Syria border, the Lebanon-Syria border is also becoming functionally blurred and clearly no longer deters Israel's strategic decision makers.  &#10;&#10;At the most immediate level, the strikes will likely embolden Assad to play a traditional nationalist card to strengthen support among his remaining loyalists. Over in Israel, Netanyahu can appear to be making statesmanlike decisions ahead of a likely bruising election and it cannot be a coincidence that he was in the US when the bombing happened - a nod perhaps to a US green light and the durability of that continued relationship.  	The air strikes will embolden Syria's Assad to play the nationalist card to&#10;strengthen support among his loyalists.&#10;&#10;

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd founder Jack Ma joined by Alibaba executives and NYSE CEO Tom Farley gather around the post during their IPO at the New York Stock Exchange in New York September 19, 2014. A new survey shows that investors are more confident in U.S. capital markets than they have been since 2009. (Reuters/Ben Hider)  &#10;&#10;I actually know something about China. I lived there and helped U.S. companies negotiate trade deals and contracts, but it was not a glamorous job. I spent my last night in China in June 1989 in a baggage X-ray machine at the Beijing Airport as tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square.  &#10;&#10;Only one bus full of Japanese tourists made it to the airport the next morning, and I sneaked out of my hiding place and slipped into their lines … unnoticed. Not long after that I watched on television as a brave young man tried to block a phalanx of tanks heading into the square. The world learned something very important that day: Get in the way of the Chinese Communist Party and you’ll be crushed.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;The Chinese economy is now estimated by some to be larger than our own. Radio talk show host Mark Levin even predicted on his show that the U.S. would lose its technological advantage to the Chinese within 10 years. How will this happen? Will China send its tanks to New York City and invade the banks, or to Silicon Valley to steal away our intellectual property? No need to; we’re actually handing them our wealth. And, oddly enough, many seem pretty content about it.  &#10;&#10;I’m not a protectionist, but I’m no sucker, either. Preserving free markets takes work, but what’s strange is that today we’re actively distorting markets to the detriment of our domestic industries. History is replete with governments working against Adam Smith’s invisible hand, but always with the intention of protecting their own. We’re doing the opposite.  &#10;&#10;There has been a debate brewing for decades within conservative circles over whether Congress should give deference to the 10th Amendment and allow States to control their own sales tax systems, or whether they should be prevented from collecting sales taxes on goods sold online under the guise of lower taxes. In my mind there’s nothing conservative or free market about protecting businesses from competition.  &#10;&#10;Since online shopping became the rage a decade and a half ago, Americans have enjoyed buying items — from home necessities to Christmas presents — without paying sales tax. I made up my mind on this issue in the 1990s after I kept hearing some politicians assert that Internet companies must be nurtured and protected while in their infancy.  &#10;&#10;There’s nothing conservative or free market about protecting businesses from competition. Amazon and eBay look extremely well nurtured after decades of special tax treatment, while mom-and-pop Main Street retailers have been forced to charge sales tax.  &#10;&#10;Well, a game changer named Alibaba, a billion-dollar Chinese e-commerce marketplace that’s bigger than Amazon and eBay,combined, is now entering the American market.  &#10;&#10;Fresh off the largest IPO in Wall Street history and flush with cash, within two years Alibaba and its hundreds of thousands of Chinese retailers will be selling the same goods and products to Americans the same way Amazon does. It’s bad enough that local stores have had to compete on a tilted playing field against American e-tailers, but extending this uncompetitive advantage to subsidized overseas giants like Alibaba could spell the end for countless American business owners.  &#10;&#10;Congress has the power to change this, and the U.S. Senate has already overwhelmingly voted 69-27 to pass the Marketplace Fairness Act to close the online sales tax loophole. Even Amazon, which fought closing the sales tax loophole for years, now supports the Marketplace Fairness Act.  &#10;&#10;Conservatives in the Senate were divided on this vote, my hope is state legislatures will follow conservative Gov. Scott Walker’s lead in Wisconsin and pass laws offsetting any revenue increases with corresponding income tax cuts. Conservatives should be of one mind to keep taxes as low as possible, and we can also work to ensure that markets remain free and competitive. It is now up to the House of Representatives to decide if they’re going to stand up for small businesses or cut them off at the knees with a wet kiss for Alibaba.  &#10;&#10;If you’re kissing Alibaba, you’re essentially in bed with the Chinese government and its Communist Party, which cares even less about the American economy than it cared for the heroic student who stood in front of the tanks in Tiananmen Square. As a recent Wall Street Journal editorial put it:  &#10;&#10;“[N]o one in China earns or keeps such wealth or celebrity without support from the Communist Party. … [Alibaba’s Chairman Jack] Ma recently accompanied President Xi Jinping on a state visit to South Korea, and a strong IPO debut could yield billion-dollar payouts for Beijing’s sovereign wealth fund and several private investment firms tied to children and grandchildren of Party leaders.”  &#10;&#10;Why on earth would conservatives and Republicans want to undercut the local small businesses they claim to represent in favor of an online retailing Goliath backed by the Chinese government? This would be the height of lunacy.  &#10;&#10;A standard talking point for GOP leaders, office holders and candidates has been to strongly advocate for small business. If House Republicans don’t close this loophole, the damage done to the GOP’s relationship with one of its core constituencies could be irreparable. How many GOP incumbents want to see this ad run against them in the next election?  &#10;&#10;It would be both good politics and good policy to close the loophole so everyone – including Alibaba – has to compete by the same rules. That is, after all, what a free market is all about.  &#10;&#10;Dan Schneider is executive director of the American Conservative Union.

During a radio interview this week, French President Francois Hollande said Russian President Vladimir Putin "doesn't want to annex eastern Ukraine - he told me that".  &#10;&#10;He even suggested that western sanctions should be eased. Hollande's naivety harks back to George W Bush's infamous comments about Putin in 2001. When asked by a reporter if he could trust Putin, he responded; "I looked the man in the eye. I found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy… I was able to get a sense of his soul." As a former KGB officer, Putin probably looked into Bush's eyes and saw a case number!  &#10;&#10;In reality, Putin has done nothing to demonstrate that his commitment to Hollande is genuine. Crimea is still under the control of Russia after its illegal annexation last year. Moscow continues to occupy the Georgian breakaway provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Russian weapons and equipment are still pouring into eastern Ukraine.  &#10;&#10;As recently as last November, NATO confirmed another build-up of Russian military equipment and troops inside Ukraine.  &#10;&#10;Russia's next moves  &#10;&#10;In light of Russia's recent behaviour, what can be expected in eastern Ukraine in 2015? Predictions of this sort are almost impossible and are usually invariably wrong. However, it is possible to develop various scenarios that could offer a glimpse into what Russia's plans might be. Russia's ultimate goal is to keep Ukraine out of the transatlantic community - the EU and NATO. Russia will also want to consolidate the gains made by separatist forces in eastern Ukraine. To this end, Russia will have short-term and long term goals.  &#10;&#10;The primary short-term goal for Russia in Ukraine will be to keep the conflict in eastern Ukraine "frozen" - meaning that while the bullets might stop flying, there will be no real effort to bring a conclusive end to the conflict.  &#10;&#10;This equates to victory for Moscow and defeat for Kiev because it leaves Ukraine not in control of all its territory. Russia can also use the "frozen" status of separatist-controlled regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as bargaining chips in future talks with the West on other issues.  &#10;&#10;In terms of Russia's longer term goals in Ukraine for 2015 and beyond, there are a number of scenarios that can play out.  &#10;&#10;It is safe to assume that Moscow will help the separatists consolidate gains in Donetsk and Luhansk to create a political entity that becomes more like a viable state. This will be no easy task and will require the capture of important communication and transit nodes, such as Donetsk airport, the city of Mariupol and its port, and the Luhansk power plant. These are still under Ukrainian government control but are all needed if the separatists want to achieve true autonomy.  &#10;&#10;A more ambitious scenario might see Russia expanding separatist-controlled areas to include the entire eastern region of Ukraine consisting of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and the eastern sections of Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv oblasts. This would require capturing Kharkiv, which is Ukraine's second largest city. Kharkiv also holds a certain degree of symbolism for those in Moscow dreaming of the days of Soviet glory - it was the first city in Ukraine to recognise the Bolshevik takeover in 1917.  &#10;&#10;The most aggressive scenario might see Moscow attempting to re-establish control of the historical Novorossiya region in modern-day southern Ukraine. This would create a land bridge between Russia and Crimea - eventually linking up with the Russian-backed Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova.  &#10;&#10;This would be no easy undertaking and would require the capture of the heavily defended cities of Mariupol and Odessa, Ukraine's tenth-largest and third- largest cities, respectively.  &#10;&#10;Russia is desperate to establish a land bridge to Crimea since the cost of providing goods and services by sea and air to the peninsula is becoming prohibitively expensive. In fact, Putin has ordered a bridge linking the Russian mainland with Crimea to be built by 2018.  &#10;&#10;With an economy in recession, the collapse of the rouble, and the low price of oil, finding the $5.2bn required to build the bridge might not be possible. Instead, Russia could be forced into creating a land bridge to Crimea.  &#10;&#10;Out of all of Russia's previous leaders, Putin has more in common with Russia's imperial czars than he does with the Soviet premiers. Perhaps Putin has most in common with Emperor Nicolas I who ruled Russia between 1825 and 1855. Nicolas I's reign was marked by a stagnate economy, territorial expansions in the Caucasus, the crushing of political dissent, and a war in Crimea.  &#10;&#10;In the case of Nicolas I, his war in Crimea was disastrous and could have had serious implications for his rule if he had not died from pneumonia before the war ended. Will Crimea prove the same for Putin today? Only time will tell. One thing is for certain: Russia's designs on eastern Ukraine are far from over, 2015 will prove to be a very interesting year.

Salam, my name is Ali. I am twelve years old.  &#10;&#10;We were in between lessons during our first class, when we suddenly heard the sound of shooting. It was very aggressive noise. We did not have time to even imagine what it could be.  &#10;&#10;Within moments as the noise got closer to our class room our teacher told us to hide beneath our desks.  &#10;&#10;"Get under your desk, fast, get under your desk," she said. Some of us cowered. Some of us stood confused and panicked. The whole classroom started asking our teacher "what is happening".  &#10;&#10;Screaming children from the classrooms next door shocked us. It scared me so much, I could not even scream.  &#10;&#10;Our teacher was just about to lock the door when three militants stormed in the door.  &#10;&#10;They were already shooting, and I saw my teacher and class fellows immediately get hurt. Some of my friends started falling down (after being hit). Many of us went under our tables.  &#10;&#10;I knew I was going to die and started crying. Everyone was crying but no one (in my class) tried running away.  &#10;&#10;They shot my class fellows in the head, in the chest, on their arms, on the legs and in the stomach. Everyone was on the ground. Maybe, they knew many of us were alive. Then they started shooting straight in the skull.  &#10;&#10;Bullets went over our heads. My best friend and class bench partner Irfan Ullah told me, "pretend we are dead." I was shaking with fear. Our seats are in the last row of the classroom.  &#10;&#10;"Lay still, Ali, Lay still" he whispered to me. I was turned upside down. Everything happened very fast. I knew it was the terrorist. I knew it was Taliban.  &#10;&#10;My friend also got hit with bullets. I don't know which parts of his body but he didn't speak. I could hear him breath next to me.  &#10;&#10;One terrorist screamed to the other, "Is that one dead?" and then I heard bullets and more shots. I felt like I was dead.  &#10;&#10;They spoke in Pashto and were wearing shalwar kameez. All of them had long brown beards.  &#10;&#10;When they left the room, I whispered to Irfan, but he didn't respond. I thought he is playing dead. I continued (to play dead).  &#10;&#10;I was very scared they will come back. I don't know when my friend died. He saved my life.  &#10;&#10;I thought I was dead but my heart was beating very fast. I couldn't move.  &#10;&#10;I played dead for several hours. When the soldiers came to rescue, I could not move and remained still. I did not know if they were real soldiers. And I could not speak. I was very scared.  &#10;&#10;I heard constant noise of bullets outside my class but didn't have the strength to open my eyes. There was huge explosion. I thought the world will explode today.  &#10;&#10;When someone picked me up I kept my eyes closed. It was the army soldiers.  &#10;&#10;I started crying. They took me to my parents.  &#10;&#10;I have come here to the hospital. So many of my schoolmates are here who are short of blood. I am offering my blood for donation.  &#10;&#10;My parents insisted that we should go home. They are worried about me. They are sad. They are scared. I am scared too. But I am worried about my brothers and sisters who are at the hospital too.  &#10;&#10;These Taliban are evil.  &#10;&#10;I can't believe I am alive.  &#10;&#10;If my country needs me, I am here to offer my life.  &#10;&#10;I will fight these terrorists who killed my friends. I will not forgive them. God is watching.  	This is the testimony of 12-year-old Ali, survivor of the Peshawar massacre,&#10;as recorded by journalist Kiran Nazish.&#10;&#10;
296-wordslutfeministseffortsreclai	guardian	2015-01-20T20:36:20Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/20/word-slut-feminists-efforts-reclaim-it	Jessica Valenti	Will the awful power of the word 'slut' defeat feminists' efforts to reclaim it?	It’s been over twenty years since then-Bikini Kill frontwoman and Riot Grrrl icon Kathleen Hanna scrawled the word SLUT across her stomach. In the years since, there’s been a book called Slut!, countless feminist debates over the reclamation of the word “slut” and, in 2011, thousands of women took to streets across the globe in anti-rape marches called SlutWalks – a reference to how victims of sexual assault are often blamed for the violence done to them.  &#10;&#10;Like “cunt” and “bitch”, many feminists have long tried to wrest away from its original users the power and harm of the word “slut” and to give it new meaning. Increasingly, though, it’s seeming like we might not succeed any time soon.  &#10;&#10;Take Leora Tanenbaum: in 2000, she wrote Slut!: Growing up Female with a Bad Reputation chronicling girls’ and women’s experiences with the word. She herself was called a “slut” as a high school student in the 1980s – long before the term “sexual harassment” was coined – and told me “I had no vocabulary to understand what happened.”  &#10;&#10;Now, 15 years later, Tanenbaum is about to publish another book: I Am Not a Slut because, in part, the sheen of reclaiming “slut” seems to have worn off over the years. When she spoke to women who called themselves “sluts” with a “positive and defiant” spirit, all told her the decision had turned against them later – and all regretted it.  &#10;&#10;Tanenbaum told me that, when women are in closed circle or close-knit community – like a protest with like-minded people, or among friends who understand the cheeky appropriation of the word – identifying as a “slut” can be empowering. But what inevitably happens, especially in today’s digital culture where revenge porn, stolen pictures and cyber harassment is the norm, is that “it always spills outwards.”  &#10;&#10;For them it was an amazing feminist experience, but it didn’t last. Every single person I spoke to who intentionally embraced a “slut” persona ended up being treated terribly by people outside of her circle, because the culture we live in is so dominated by the sexual double standard.  &#10;&#10;But beyond women who tried to reclaim “slut” for themselves, other feminists have rightfully asked why we should all try to reclaim a word with so much baggage – especially a word that impacts different women differently, and brings them a lot more pain than righteous justice.  &#10;&#10;SlutWalks, for example, are no longer the cause célèbre they once were because some women of color spoke out against the ways in which the protests and the reclamation of “slut” focused on the ability of white women to simultaneously embrace the word and reject its meaning. A group of black female academics, activists, and writers wrote an open letter explaining that “as Black women, we do not have the privilege or the space to call ourselves ‘slut’ without validating the already historically entrenched ideology and recurring messages about what and who the Black woman is.”  &#10;&#10;Rutgers professor and writer Brittney Cooper wrote at the time, “To organize a movement around the reclamation of a term is in and of itself an act of white privilege.” In response, some SlutWalk organizers changed the name of their protests; today, while a handful of SlutWalks remain, the excitement over the movement has waned noticeably.  &#10;&#10;But women everywhere are still being actively, physically hurt by the stereotypes that lead people to call them “sluts”. Just look to the high profile deaths of young women who were slut-shamed and a mass shooting where the killer said he was targeting “blonde sluts”: we’re still being targeted because of our identities and sexualities, and it has, perhaps appropriately, put a damper on the once-celebratory reclamation of the word. Maybe that the wounds inflicted by “slut” – and the culture that encourages people to define women that way – that we once hoped were superficial are just too raw and too deep. Maybe the speed of the internet is too fast for us to control a word with so much potential to damage.  &#10;&#10;There’s a poster on my living room wall by artist Favianna Rodriguez that reads: “I’m a Slut. I Vote. So Does Everyone I Sleep With. And You’re About to be More Fucked Than I Am.” For me, it captures the brash, in-your-face spirit that the feminist movement I’ve loved is known for.  &#10;&#10;But in this time of unprecedented feminist power, the conversation about “slut” can be more reflective than fevered. Women who want to call themselves “sluts” shouldn’t stop, or be made to stop – I love that women can embrace that which is meant to hurt them and find power in it. But I also know that we can still claim our sexuality and agency without using a word meant to denigrate – a word that still hurts so many people.  &#10;&#10;Besides, we don’t need “slut” to tell us what we already know: women have sex, some people don’t like that and we’re going to continue to do it anyway.

297-youngtorycampaignbusroadtrip20	guardian	2015-01-20T14:42:27Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/20/young-tory-campaign-bus-road-trip-2015	Rupert Myers	‘What happens on tour stays on tour’: how a week on a young Tory campaign bus might look	As news emerges that the Conservative party chairman, Grant Shapps, has jokingly promised young volunteers that the most active among them might get to go on holiday to Ibiza with Samantha and David Cameron, we imagine what a week on the road with the Road Trip 2015 team might look like.  &#10;&#10;“What happens on tour stays on tour,” says one young volunteer, handing out the free, blue-coloured contraceptives as the group pass Milton Keynes, “but don’t let the guys at the back of the coach near these.” At the back are the socially conservative gang. One has taken his “It’s not Adam & Steve” commemorative pin badge off and is using it to pierce the condoms. The rest of the coach has just finished playing “identify the Ayn Rand quote”, and near the front of the bus the libertarians are swapping pill bottles. “This is bat country,” one of them mutters, while another reads a book on the gold standard.  &#10;&#10;After a day’s leafleting in North Warwickshire, the team heads to the nearest Holiday Inn where a curry is being prepared. It has taken two days for “Banter Bus” to emerge as the name of the team vehicle, edging out Winning Wagon and Chat Coach. “How to spot a Labour voter” is the topic of conversation, and it is generally agreed that they are the ones who fly-tip in their own front gardens. Within minutes of the party chairman telling the audience that the most successful campaigners may get to throw shapes with Sam Cam in Ibiza, groups have split off into the corners of the room to form campaign teams. A mixture of Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Taylor Swift is encouraging young attendees to adjust their pocket squares and hit the dance floor.  &#10;&#10;The team encounter a group of Labour supporters who – as Central Office training suggested – broke into tears and fled when shown the standard-issue photograph of Ed Miliband standing in a puddle. Volunteers carry the auto- tuned Nick Clegg apology for similar purposes, but headquarters has yet to devise a Ukip strategy. Later in the afternoon there is a brief tangle with the media as two young men brawl over the correct pronunciation of “Boadicea”. Local press are quick to the scene, and get shots of the men before they’ve been encouraged to remove their rosettes and tie pins. Insiders whisper that it’s really an argument about whose dance card was marked last night.  &#10;&#10;“Oxbridge people get it,” says one young man as he leans over the table of a group of women enjoying their fourth curry dinner of the trip. This is the first floor restaurant of a Hilton Doubletree, with all the ambience of a young offenders’ institution. The women have taken to dining in a protective circle with their handbags on the backs of their chairs, reminiscent of the Roman Legion’s “testudo” or “tortoise” formation. A second man leans in to say, “Really, most people will agree that it’s actually ‘Doxbridge’.” Later that night there are unconfirmed reports that the man who invented the “Doxbridge” portmanteau to include his alma mater of Durham has been shivved with a plastic Liam Fox doll and has left the trip.  &#10;&#10;“We’re all in this together,” one volunteer cheerfully tells the receptionist as the Banter Bus makes an unexpected stop at a sexual health clinic. The volunteers pile off and spend the morning getting tested, only for a red-faced doctor to explain that their symptoms (flatulence, lethargy) are the result of too much curry, and that since only two of them have been sexually active in the past month, this has been a complete waste of NHS time and money. “We love the NHS,” a group leader protests, as the others try very hard to look like they’re one of the two. For the rest of the day everything is described as “sound”, and after six hours of delivering leaflets in the rain, the team opt for KFC and vodka shots.  &#10;&#10;The team are cold. Not only was the heating broken in the village hall they slept in last night, but the windows of the bus have all had to be kept open. The driver has pointed to a European directive safeguarding his working conditions, which has forced the team to crack the sunroof. By lunchtime, the cold and the EU directive has unified two groups who previously had not shared three words with each other, as the socially conservative volunteers and the libertarians demand the coach be stopped outside a Ukip field headquarters for them to defect. As one of the libertarians mutters “sound” at the sight of the Ukip flag, a Team 2015 staffer screams,“You can’t say that, that’s our word”, and has a cry.  &#10;&#10;In a recount of the votes minus the defectors, the vehicle has reverted to Chat Coach, and the group are arguing whether David Davis or Theresa May would survive longest on a desert island before someone lets slip that they know how to buy Twitter followers. Within a few minutes the group are all upping their social media presence. That evening the Chat Coach stops for the final time, and the revellers enjoy an Ibiza-themed beer and curry night followed by Ibiza-themed laser quest. One volunteer overhears Samantha Cameron’s assistant screaming at Shapps over the phone, stating in no uncertain terms that Samantha would rather be trapped in a steam room with the two Eds than go on holiday with Team 2015, and that he could stick his competition. The volunteer tweets excitedly to his 30,000 followers, only to remember that none of them are real. What happens on tour really does stay on tour.  	Rupert Myers: Curry, booze and Tory singletons … what could be better? And all eyes are on the prize: a holiday with Sam and Cam in Ibiza
298-youngvupssupremecourtshoulduph	foxnews	2014-12-03T14:00:50Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/12/03/young-v-ups-supreme-court-should-uphold-rights-pregnant-workers/	Rachel Laser, Galen Carey	 Young v. UPS: Supreme Court should uphold rights of pregnant workers	FILE -- Nov. 14, 2014: Peggy Young, of Lorton, Va., with her daughter Triniti, 7, in Washington. Young was pregnant when the company told her she could not have a temporary assignment to avoid lifting heavy packages, as her doctor ordered. She sued UPS for discriminating against pregnant women and, after losing two rounds in lower courts, the Supreme Court will hear her case on December 3.  &#10;&#10;One of us is pro-choice and the other is pro-life, but we both believe that the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (PDA) properly requires that pregnant employees like Peggy Young, a former UPS worker whose case is being heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, be treated the same as other workers who are similarly limited in their ability to perform certain tasks at work.  &#10;&#10;This case has brought together unlikely allies, from both the pro-choice and pro-life communities, who share a commitment to justice for women in the workplace.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;Passed in 1978 as an amendment to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the PDA expands the definition of sex discrimination to include pregnancy. Its plain language makes clear that the test for a PDA claim is whether a pregnant woman receives the same treatment “as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work.”  &#10;&#10;In order to reinforce that the origin of the employees’ limitation must not control, the 2014 Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Guidelines further clarify that “an employer may not refuse to treat a pregnant worker the same as other employees who are similar in their ability or inability to work by relying on a policy that makes distinctions based on the source of an employee’s limitations.”  &#10;&#10;Both pro-life and pro-choice groups and members of Congress advocated for the passage of the PDA.  &#10;&#10;Both sides agreed that employers should not be able to push a woman out of the workforce and potentially even into poverty based on pregnancy.  &#10;&#10;The PDA was meant to ensure that a pregnant woman should not have to choose between the health—or existence---of her pregnancy, and her ability to participate in, and derive economic stability for herself and her family from, the workplace.  &#10;&#10;Young’s scenario is exactly that which the PDA sought to address.  &#10;&#10;For close to 10 years, Young worked at UPS in Landover, Maryland as an early morning air driver. When she became pregnant, her midwife recommended that she lift no more than 20 pounds during her pregnancy. UPS already allowed a wide range of people with physical limitations to work light duty, including workers injured on the job, workers protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act, and others with a wide variety of medical conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, vision or hearing problems, limb impairments, sleep apnea and emotional problems.  &#10;&#10;Citing union restrictions, UPS refused to give a similar accommodation to Young. As a result, Young and her family lost her pay and insurance benefits for the remainder of her pregnancy.  &#10;&#10;We reject this treatment as not just illegal but immoral. Though UPS recently changed their policy to add pregnant women to the list of those allowed to work light duty (the union did not in fact prevent UPS from changing its policy), they still argue that the PDA does not require them to give this accommodation to Young.  &#10;&#10;This is unacceptable. Pregnant women like Young must be able to carry healthy pregnancies and be full participants in the workforce, as the PDA intended. This vital protection must not be left to the whims of employers.  &#10;&#10;Now more than ever, women depend on their attachment to the labor-force. A record 40 percent of all households with children under the age of 18 include mothers who are either the sole or primary source of income for the family (nearly double the number at the time of the passage of the PDA).  &#10;&#10;Seventy percent of women with children under the age of eighteen work outside the home. And nearly 90 percent of women working full-time while pregnant choose to continue working into their last month of pregnancy.  &#10;&#10;The Court should uphold the rights of pregnant workers. At this divisive moment in our nation, we celebrate an issue that can bridge our differences, strengthen civil discourse and fortify our country\'s economic, political and moral foundations.  	The Court should uphold the rights of pregnant workers.&#10;&#10;
299-youtubeasksobamagopdesperately	foxnews	2015-01-23T19:58:12Z	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/01/23/youtubeasksobama-gop-desperately-needs-glozell-moment/	Richard Grenell	#YouTubeAsksObama: GOP desperately needs a 'Glozell' moment	  &#10;&#10;Republicans who mock President Obama’s interviews with the three popular YouTube Internet stars make a serious mistake. While the Obama White House is completely incompetent and weak, they know how to spin everyday Americans. The Washington media crowd, including conservative media, preaches to the choir of news junkies. The idea that you can win a modern presidential election without being modern is what should be mocked.  &#10;&#10;How can it be that some Republicans still don’t understand that young people aren’t watching “Meet the Press” or “Fox News Sunday”? In fact, news junkies are watching less “Meet the Press.” Young people are getting their news from YouTube, Facebook and Ellen. And Team Obama has largely monopolized the playgrounds where Millennials are hanging out.  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;ADVERTISEMENT  &#10;&#10;The YouTube interviews inside the White House were an easy home run for the president’s communications team. The White House must love the ridiculing they are getting from conservatives, too. The more out of touch Republicans seem, the easier their job to spin young people becomes.  &#10;&#10;The Internet stars who interviewed Obama have a combined reach of thirteen million people – and most of them aren’t following politics. They are ‘gettable’ and Democrats are reaching them. Republicans need to change their elitist attitudes -- and fast. Voters aren’t as informed as we want them to be and the Democrats have figured out how to reach them with simple messages.  &#10;&#10;I am not sure how anyone could criticize the president’s outreach to thirteen million people. After all, one YouTube host informed the president that during the State of the Union address, the most Googled question in America was “How old is Obama?”  &#10;&#10;Hank Green, a wildly successful vlogger with his brother, who regularly reaches 2.4 million people through their YouTube videos, started off the round-robin interviews by thanking the president for welcoming him to his house. Obama, showing incredible connectivity with his audience responded with an analogy that every young person understands. “I’m actually leasing (this house), and my lease runs out in two years. I hope to get my security deposit back,” said Obama.  &#10;&#10;Green, who was born in 1980, focused his questions on what young, non-news junkies are thinking about their government. Green asked whether something can “really get done in Washington,” how drone strikes make sense and whether or not more sanctions can work on a country like North Korea.  &#10;&#10;His questioning was serious. Green also asked one of the smartest questions Obama has had over the last six years. Green told the president, “I don’t smoke pot…I think it’s bad for my brain…but I’m for legalization….how do we move forward out of this legal gray-ness?” It was a way of forming a question many in the White House press corps have never thought about.  &#10;&#10;Green finished the interview by sharing with Obama a receipt for a prescription drug medication that he said cost $1,100 but because he enrolled in ObamaCare now costs $5.  &#10;&#10;The moment was a strong message for the millions watching. The president didn’t miss the moment either and said of ObamaCare, “We had some bad hiccups initially…but the website works really well now.”  &#10;&#10;Glozell Simon, a 52-year-old comedian who goes by the name Glozell Green and reaches 3 million people, was up next. Glozell surprised the Washington crowd by first asking, “Why didn’t the government help Sony feel protected and safe enough to release the film on time?”  &#10;&#10;She went on to tell the president she cut off the hoodies from her husband’s sweatshirts because of her concern for his safety, and then asked a question about Cuba because many of her Cuban friends have concerns over Obama’s new friendship with Castro.  &#10;&#10;Glozell, who although is wildly creative and funny, was completely respectful of the situation. She asked about same sex marriage and Obama’s legacy and gave her followers a peek at the president answering easy, soft questions. The president looked and sounded relatable.  &#10;&#10;Bethany Mota, a 19-year-old YouTube star who regularly reaches eight million people was the last interviewer. Mota also asked informal but serious questions on education, cyber-bullying, Boko Haram and China.  &#10;&#10;Obama told her, “your voice is more powerful than the president of the United States.” And I am sure her young female followers agreed.  &#10;&#10;Mota, too, asked the president a question in a way traditional reporters have failed to ask. “I was just in China and couldn’t access the apps and websites I could back home,” Mota said. Obama gave her a non-answer that made him look knowledgeable but likeable.  &#10;&#10;She also said, “I never really followed politics that much…why should the younger generation be interested in politics?” The president again spun a good tale about the need for young people to get involved so they can go to college. Eight million young women now think Obama wants them to go to college. It was a brilliant move by the president.  &#10;&#10;Obama finished the round of interviews by taking a selfie with the three and adding this eye-opening insight into his reason for going around the White House press corps and sitting down with YouTube stars. Obama told them: “This is the power of what the Internet is all about…you can create content and there’s not all these barriers to entry…suddenly you get millions of people who are listening to you.”  &#10;&#10;Republicans are bound to lose the next presidential election again if they can’t communicate with new voters.  &#10;&#10;Millions of people walk into the voting booth and vote for someone they like. News junkies and Washington types casually refer to this as "Who would you want to have a beer with?" The sentiment is accurate but the analogy should be updated to "Who do you want to make a YouTube video with?"  &#10;&#10;I think President Obama is weak, bored with the office, and an incompetent leader. But he sure knows how to go around the White House press corps.  	Republicans who mock President Obama’s interviews with the three popular&#10;YouTube Internet stars make a serious mistake. While the Obama White House is&#10;completely incompetent and weak, they know how to spin everyday Americans.&#10;&#10;
300-zerosuicideschangetackledepres	guardian	2015-01-20T20:58:06Z	http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/20/zero-suicides-change-tackle-depression	Jake Mills	Zero suicides is an admirable aim but it requires all-out change	On Monday, Nick Clegg pledged to sign up the NHS to a national “zero suicide” campaign. This comes in a week when I have spent a lot of time talking to the media about depression in an attempt to get people to support Calm and the other charities that are doing incredible work to help people coping with mental illness. I have appeared on national radio, in the press and on television to talk about my story, but the more coverage I get, the more I ask: why me?  &#10;&#10;Let me make this clear. I am not famous, I am not trying to be famous. I am a normal lad who made mistakes, lived a lie, and eventually attempted to take my own life. I am just another statistic. Someone who suffered from an illness that took over my life and made me a person I didn’t recognise. There is absolutely nothing special or unique about me. Yet I am getting calls from people asking me to share my story. The fact that I am newsworthy, simply because I have spoken openly about the demons I was facing, makes me think that we are being greatly let down by society.  &#10;&#10;Suicide is the biggest single killer of men aged 20-49 in the UK. It’s a statistic that, no matter how many times I say it, continues to shock me to the core. Yet it’s something that few people seem to be talking about openly, if at all. I get it, we’re British. Sometimes we don’t like talking about things that make us uncomfortable. Sometimes we’d rather not ask the question because we can’t handle the answer. But that simply cannot continue. It’s time that people are made to stand up and face the harsh reality.  &#10;&#10;The fear of being judged is preventing people from talking about their secret turmoil. There is very little being done by the people who have the biggest influence to remove those fears, remove the stigmas, to get people talking about mental health, and make people comfortable with the subject. The media doesn’t just have influence, it has a responsibility to help communicate a message and set an agenda. Yes, things are changing, but it can’t be right that the furthest we’ve come is having someone receive live therapy on air with Phillip Schofield or a soap character crashing a minibus.  &#10;&#10;There is too much box-ticking going on. A petition signed, a campaign joined, an empty promise in an election year. All very good but what do they actually do? Do they help save enough lives? The system needs changing from top to bottom. There is no consistency or urgency, despite the high rate of men dying from suicide. What bigger wake-up call do you need?  &#10;&#10;I would ask David Cameron to speak up and tell us what he is going to do. To meet me, to let me introduce him to the small team at Calm, the volunteers, the campaigners, the people on the end of phones with someone’s life in their hands. Let me show him people who feel as if they have nowhere to turn. Let me show him the lack of knowledge of some people working in GP surgeries, and the pressure that those who make a positive difference are working under, as rates of mental illness increase continually. Let me show how so little can make such a big difference.  &#10;&#10;If Nick Clegg is serious about mental health then he needs to show it. It’s great that he has decided that we need to aim for zero suicides but I wonder, what was the aim before this? Just a few suicides? A hundred? Shouldn’t the aim always have been zero? The likes of Calm, Mind, The Samaritans and everyone else, are doing incredible work but it shouldn’t be left to them to do it all alone. They can only work with the limited resources they have. They need supporting and backing. We need to put faces and voices to genuine experiences. Speaking out about dealing with depression shouldn’t be considered a “brave” act; it shouldn’t be an extraordinary or unusual story to read. It should be common. It should be accepted. It should be normal. But while we live in a society that doesn’t know how to deal with it, and perhaps does not want to deal with it, we cannot expect people to talk openly about such private matters.  &#10;&#10;Much focus is placed on those who are suffering, and rightly so, but in order to truly help them, we need to make everyone else comfortable and knowledgeable enough to know what to do, how to act, and know how to signpost people to the help that is out there.
